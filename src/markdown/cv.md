## Profile

I enjoy the code that is written well and looks perfect.
After more than seven years of work with code of different quality, I'm noticing beauty in some projects and appreciate creators behind it.
At the same time, I realize that perfect code is almost impossible in the real world.
All the struggles behind the project do not matter if it is shipped in time and serves the business goal well.

I'm a professional software developer with strong mathematics and 
programming background. I have over seven years of experience in the field 
of the gambling industry, such as game development, calculation of PAR 
sheets, deployment of casino systems, and hardware and software 
integration.
