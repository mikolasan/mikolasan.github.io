## FAQ

My channel has 0 subscribers right now ðŸ¤  Though I have 14 on another Russian oriented channel. I'm not consistent with my content and I assume those 14 people are crazy ðŸ˜†

Maybe because with social networks I mainly helping to my wife. A year ago she has started a channel about coloring with pencils. Just recently she achieved 1000 subs. It is a slow but steady growth. With this long preface I wanted to say that she received about 30% of her traffic from Facebook community where she posted her work.

### Q: Facebook to YouTube conversion

**Q:** I cannot post a video or youtube channel link on facebook. Otherwise they will ban my account permanently. They have strict rule about spam. I hate facebook

**A:** If you want to promote your YouTube channel on Facebook, then the Group or a Page should be public. You need to capture their attention without a link - that's the tricky part. Then say "link in bio".

### Q: Where to find free templates for video thumbnails?

**A:** I do not know any good and ready to use templates. You need to play around in Photoshop and find your style

### Q: I need 4000 watch hours to complete monetization process. How?

**A:** I guess you know that monetization depends on clicks and hours. Let's say you get 4000 hours and monetization begins, you will need another 4000 hours to convert them to money. So think how to get 4000 hours constantly

I did some primitive math: if you have one 15 min video and it will get 10000 views (watched from the beginning to the end), then it equals to 2500 hours.

You need to produce something with high demand. Something unique. For example showing all secrets in the game

### Q: Who can i made a video viral?

**A:** Viral - you never know. It usually something stupid. Better be consistent and make good quality content that you would like to watch by yourself

### Q: Give me some tips to make it better.

**A:** I think it would not hurt to add playlists. It will structure many videos that you have there.
