title: '"Why do I hate ...?" article series'
---

All programming languages have they own quirks. That is why I started "Why do I hate ...?" article series.

It is not about my hate, because I do not really hate languages, or computers, or compilers. Absolutely not.

Here is a list of published articles:

- [Java](/blog/why-do-i-hate-java)
- [Python](/blog/why-do-i-hate-python)

Articles that are planned for release:

- C++
- Lua
- C#
- JavaScript

Everyone should start learning programming! Pascal, C, C++, Java, Fortran, you name it 📖 👨‍💻
