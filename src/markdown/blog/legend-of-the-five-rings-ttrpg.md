## Our play session

### Act 1

We’re in medieval Japan investigating the theft of food supplies vital for the village’s survival. We enter a warehouse to look for any clues, but the most skilled detective comes up with absolutely nothing.

Luckily, we have two magistrates on the team. The second one finds a bloodstained scrap of clothing but has no idea how to track down its owner. The town mayor hinted that the merchant guild is plotting some conspiracy against him.

Our brave magistrate enters the first shop, he comes across and beats the spirit out of the merchant with a stick, demanding to know about the conspiracy and where he's hiding the stolen food.

Police squads search every house of the merchant guild trying to find the stashed supplies. Several days of searching. Nothing.

Our young fire mage saves the day by deciding to summon an earth spirit. He goes to the warehouse with the scrap of clothing, performs the necessary ritual, and has a vision: he sees a chicken. A chicken?

End of Act One.

### Act 2

It turns out that in the hierarchy of this world, only special people, the untouchables, deal with dirty work involving corpses and blood. So, we go to their district. None of the detectives have slept yet.

Dawn is approaching, and the huts of the hinin district are shrouded in mist. The elder is clearly covering for someone. A monk in our group has a special relationship with the hinin but tries to hide from the group what the elder told him. Intrigue.

Tries, you see? In front of two experienced detectives. From him, but essentially from the elder, we learn whose hands the bandits were acting through and where the stash of hidden supplies is. As we approach the warehouse, we see that our previous actions have alarmed the rebels, and they are hastily loading several carts, clearly planning to take everything out of the city and leave us empty-handed.

We have guards, a police squad, and the deputy mayor, Nonako, on a great horse. Some members of the group manage to take strategic positions: the mage climbs onto the roof, the magistrate sneaks into a side passage. And the battle begins.

The duelist jumps onto the cart, Nonako knocks down the drivers from his horse like Legolas, the mage summons a tornado, causing chaos at the entrance. As a mountain of bodies piles up at the warehouse’s main gate, the magistrate is still sneaking towards the back entrance, where he throws a pocket knife and kills one of the rebels about to burn all the paper evidence.

As they stop the last cart, Nonako notices a ninja slipping out of the warehouse, trying to escape down a parallel alley...
