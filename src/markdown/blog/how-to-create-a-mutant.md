title: How to create a mutant?

More specifically is how hard is to make mermaids for real?

recombinant animals
transgenic rodents

Here is the correct way of asking it: how to create a transgenic organism?

That is a good start 

https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/recombinant-dna-technology-and-transgenic-animals-34513/

And 

https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetic-mutation-1127/

Then closer to the desired topic

And

It is possible to combine several different DNA pieces and then add it two the target organism. Based on this paper: Jackson, D. A., et al. Biochemical method for inserting new genetic information into DNA of simian virus 40: Circular SV40 DNA molecules containing lambda phage genes and the galactose operon of Escherichia coli. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 69, 2904â€“2909 (1972)

growing proteins in plants
vaccine expressed in plants (just chew it)

Though the best bet would be on this book

I'll go to my library
