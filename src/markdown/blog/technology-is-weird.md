Once in a while I like to step aside and think about where weâ€™re all going, about the big picture of some sort. It's hilarious how we use computers.

Streaming services everyday transfer our favorite tracks over the network again and again instead of saving it once on a hard drive.

Starting from cracking Enigma and calculating path to the Moon, evolving to brain models, why did we end up here?
