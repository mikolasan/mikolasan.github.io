What is the best navigation option for a website on mobile device? 

- Hamburger menu
- Tap bar
- Bottom navigation
- Slide-out menu
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Sticky nav bar
- Search based navigation

Or I missing something better?

I've read today that with current average size of mobile screens it will be convenient to [put nav bar to the bottom side](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/bottom-navigation-pattern-mobile-web-pages/). I believe it's just a theory, whereas UI is usually driven by habits.
