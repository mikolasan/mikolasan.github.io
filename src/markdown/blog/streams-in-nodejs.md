I'm trying to add "last updated" time to [my blog on Gatsby](blog/what-static-site-generator).


## Timeline

- Day 1. Install Gulp
- Day 2. Recursively get a list of files where date is needed 
- Day 3. I don't know about streams in Nodejs. How to use **through2**? ðŸ¤¯
- Day 4. I don't want to read about **through2**, its API is irrational ðŸ™Š
- Day 5. No
- Day 6. Nope
- Day 7. Finished with the search bar
- Day 8. The light came, I understand how to use secrets in GitHub's actions
- Day 9. Updated Gatsby to 4. It broke GraphQL queries with `childImageSharp`. Fixed by undocumented feature mentioned in a comment on Gatsby's issue tracker.
- Day 10. Back to Gulp. I'm getting file contents ðŸ¥³. Am I following tutorials? No, I'm adopting code from other plugins ðŸ¤ 
- Day 11. Crafted 2 `git log` commands to get date when file was initially published and last modification time. The result from child process comes in callback, so I will need to figure out how to wrap it in a `Promise` and return this thing from Gulp's task.
- Day 12. I wanted to report here that I was consumed by [Dapp investigation](/blog/all-that-web3-shit) and did 0 progress, but then opened my draft notes from the yesterday and did small refactoring. I still disagree with the statement:

> "Streams are node's best and most misunderstood idea"

- Day 13 - Day 20. No progress whatsoever.
- Day 21. Done. Final [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/mikolasan/mikolasan.github.io/blob/gatsby/gulpfile.js) file

## Takeout

Just for fun and educational purposes I tried to avoid new dependencies. I could use **gulp-git**, **gulp-replace** or **gulp-inject-string** modules, but instead I studied their code and used only bare minimum for my needs.

I learned about `/d` flag in RegEx and a little about Transform.

The turning point happened when I realized that transform inside transform is not going to work, and that `pipe()` doesn't take gulp's task as an argument. Sounds silly now, but lack of tutorials and dynamic types were telling me: why not? ðŸ‘¿
