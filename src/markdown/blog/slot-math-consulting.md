## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

**What tools do you have on your website?** slot examples

**What are you good at as a writer?** personal stories

**What do you do better than anyone else?** coding, understanding of science articles (mathematics, bioinformatics, machine learning) and explaining like you are 15 years old (sometimes 5 is enough), experience in gambling industry

### Weaknesses

Not organized. Working very slow, because I'm the only one, not a team.

### Opportunities

casino and online casino is very restricted market, so not that many people who knows how.

### Threats

Many other blogs with good design and information (didn't check that it is from my niche). Companies doing all-in-one products, where I'm targeting to one's person job.
