I desperately want to write a review.

I usually read one or two books a year, therefore I'm not the one who writes reviews for a living. It just happened that I want to compare this book with an old quest game.

Cartographers by Peng Shepherd. 

As the author mentions in the Acknowledgements, this book might never been finished. And unfortunately, this is noticeable. The first chapter is very poetic and reminded me of The Broken Sword (the first one is called The Shadow of the Templars). Which I can describe as a cartoonish and romantic adventure in a Paris setting.

But then it dries out. Somewhere later in stagey narration through flashbacks, in about 5 random paragraphs, this literary style is waking up again.

After the buoyant start, I expected an optimistic love journey, but it was sad. I was sad after not well explained betrayal between friends caused by sex addiction. And such despair to see the main characters staying optimistic after they understand how everything is fucked up in their lives.

This book is based on an interesting true story. But I give it 3 out of 5 stars. I decided to use a very simplistic rating system in the beginning. Where 5 means that I enjoyed reading the book. 4 - some moments could be better, but in general, the book gives a pleasant pastime. When I say 3, it categorizes the book as tolerable and, perhaps, good, but I would not recommend it to anyone. 2 and 1? Hopefully, I will not find myself reading anything of that level.
