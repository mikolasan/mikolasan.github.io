It was a regular Sunday walk, but when I saw this guy in a car, my thoughts turned into an unexpected question about robots.

The car stood out from the normal crowd in that area. Itâ€™s usually Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari, and a bunch of Teslas. But this was really old Ford, an old truck.

Its color was fantastic, like a painting. It was made of several layers of different colors. All these layers decayed, and it was creating fluid gradients between blue, black and scratches. 

It was cold outside, but he was driving with open windows, probably because the car was not functioning properly and the heat from the engine was going straight to the cabin. The guy was listening that kind of hard-core metal music that makes you jump into the mosh pit. He had a short haircut, which is often not what you like but what is the cheapest option. 

This wasn't one of those, life is beating me and I'm trying to survive the best as I can. It was more like, I don't care what people think, this the best version of me.

So what does make him feel comfortable driving this car? And why I feel uncomfortable to seeing this car everyday, if it was my car.

Is it about our childhood? What we saw in our parent when we were growing up? How parents treated us and made us feel comfortable in some conditions? Or maybe the guy is just lazy to fix his AC.

So what does make us feel comfortable about one situation versus another? How do we develop this feeling? Then I transferred this question to robots. How to train robots to make them feel comfortable about some decisions and not comfortable about others?
