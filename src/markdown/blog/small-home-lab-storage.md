For my wife who records video every week, and edits them for her YouTube channel where she already has >1k subscribers I want to build a small home NAS server with initial storage capacity of 8TB where 4TB will be collected from current external HDD drives, plus we estimate 4TB of new content coming in the following year. 

Luckily for our budget, she records in 1080p in has no plans in upgrading to 4K. Current setup looks like this. She records video to Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Though we recently “upgraded” her phone to Samsung A52 with 3 cameras, she noticed drop in video quality, thus she is going to continue to record on S7.

I’ve started looking into buying a server rack, and drooling on the red drives with 14TB and 10GB network cards, while my initial thought was to use a single-board computer like Raspberry Pi, but with PCI-e or at least SATA ports, not USB.

The last month my wife made $4 from her channel. So I would limit our budget to $200-$300 for this initial build.

I looked at a diskless solution from WD (**My Cloud EX) but it** costs $350 which is lot for my budget. Also I considered [True NAS Scale](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/) because it’s free and [documentation](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/introduction/scalehardwareguide/) was fun to read .

But after a week of reading about possible solutions we settled on buying another external USB HDD.
