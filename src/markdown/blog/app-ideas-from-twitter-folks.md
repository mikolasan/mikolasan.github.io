## Goal manager

A goal manager, where you can set goals with deadlines and different counters, attach habits to that goals, add sub-goals and steps to achieve bigger goals and so on.

If you make such app, please inform Nick about it https://mobile.twitter.com/fromaline/status/1488919113493889026

## Twitter DMs

A Twitter DM <-> Email service  to be able to manage my DMs in my HEY inbox.

Bigger idea would be a plug and play service that allows Email, Slack, Trello etc. 

IF you make such app, please notify Joe https://mobile.twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1479094606801162241 and compare with this guy https://mobile.twitter.com/jro7/status/1479215037382377477
