## Goal manager

A goal manager, where you can set goals with deadlines and different counters, attach habits to that goals, add sub-goals and steps to achieve bigger goals and so on.

If you make such app, please [inform Nick](https://mobile.twitter.com/fromaline/status/1488919113493889026) about it 

## Twitter DMs

A Twitter DM <-> Email service  to be able to manage my DMs in my HEY inbox.

Bigger idea would be a plug and play service that allows Email, Slack, Trello etc. 

IF you make such app, please [notify Joe](https://mobile.twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1479094606801162241) and compare with this [guy](https://mobile.twitter.com/jro7/status/1479215037382377477)

## Appointment manager

Calendly + Wordle.

You can only make an appointment with me if you can solve this word puzzle in less than 6 tries. If you fail, you have to wait 24 hours before you can reattempt to schedule a meeting with me.
