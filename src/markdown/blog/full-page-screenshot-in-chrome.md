title: Full page screenshot in Chrome
---

I have to use Google Chrome because of one plugin that only supports this browser, and I'm puzzled how to make a full page screenshot. You won't believe how simple to do it in Firefox (right click anywhere on a page).

## Solution without extensions

1. `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `i`  - open dev tools
2. `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `p` - open command line
3. type `screenshot` and click on **Capture full size screenshot**
