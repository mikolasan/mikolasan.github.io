## How to get picture from remote OBS as Video Source?

In another words: How to stream from one obs to another?

May be not possible in these words, but very close [solution](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-studio-send-an-udp-stream-to-a-second-pc-using-obs.455/):

- You will need [VLC 64 bit](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-studio-how-to-get-vlc-video-source.72661/)
- Correct setup with [screenshots](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-studio-send-an-udp-stream-to-a-second-pc-using-obs.55379/page-3) (woaw, screenshots are helpful) 

And here's a [real question](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/receive-stream-from-other-obs-instance-as-source.77657/) without answer :(

Next approach would be RTMP?
