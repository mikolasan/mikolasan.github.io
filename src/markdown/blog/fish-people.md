So letâ€™s set the scene. It was winter in Novosibirsk. Snow was everywhere, and it was about to become even colder. I went to drop my car in the garage. Itâ€™s about 15 minutes walk from home.

You probably donâ€™t know, but some people live in garages. Not from a good life, of course. But itâ€™s not unusual to see furnaces in garages and smoke coming from the pipe installed on the roof. Some people even build the second story to have a window at least. Thatâ€™s premium ðŸ‘Œ

So I parked my car in the garage, closed the gates. Itâ€™s dark by the way, 10pm. The air was cold and crisp with a little taste of coal (from furnaces fired around), but suddenly the distinct smell of fish surrounded me.

I never smelled it there. There was no one around. Itâ€™s a very empty and dark line of garages and this smellâ€¦ 

I thought about people with fish heads, which are not really fish but ugly, pictured in Lovecraftâ€™s stories. And I seriously started worrying.

So I made sure that I closed the garage and quickly headed back home.

The end.

Speaking about fish people. Lovecraft stories will be with me all my life. I like his horror.
