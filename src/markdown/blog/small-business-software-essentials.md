- Debian - server OS
- Ubuntu - developer's OS. Choose LTS versions, upgrade with full reinstall.
- docker, Jenkins - automated build system (also present in GitLab, but I didn't start the migration yet)
- GitLab self-hosted (no BitBucket or GitHub) - git version control system.
- Redmine (no Jira) - issue tracker. Install [this theme](https://github.com/mrliptontea/PurpleMine2) - it will look almost like Jira
- Confluence (?) - knowledge base. Redmine is very limited, though it has simple wiki pages
- Zulip (no slack) - quick communication, file and code sharing system
