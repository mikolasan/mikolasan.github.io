So here is my take on "Why does Open Source exist?".

My opinion is a little depressing and maybe shocking for someone. Yes, my view doesn't start with words: Open Source exists because the human race goes to a bright and happy future. No, it begins with the employee's contract.

I don't know if everyone knows, that when you are working for a company, then all code you write stays in the company. Legally you cannot use any of it in another company or for your commercial/non-commercial projects.

All your hard work, all your inventions, discoveries just stay behind the walls of your company.

Very disappointing, I think. But this is called proprietary software. Only some information is shared on conferences and corporate blogs, but not more.

Who has created the first open-source library? Let's leave the question about chicken and egg for now, and consider that you work in some company. You split your work into small tasks. And for many tasks, you don't need to invent the wheel, enough to find ready-to-use libraries.

Some Open Source libraries with MIT or BSD license, correct? You don't have a problem doing it. Then you integrate a library, solve your task, go home. And it repeats day after day.
What if you want to leave your name in history? And also get stars on GitHub? 
Then you should be an author of such library! 

Don't hide your work in the company. Of course, it requires some prep work.
You need to remove all business logic, add README, Dockerfile, setup CI/CD pipelines. But you will get free QA Grinning face with smiling eyes
Then add MIT license and include it into your project. 
Profit.

Have you tried to open source code from your company? 
How often do you do it? 
If not, think about what will you show at the future interview?
