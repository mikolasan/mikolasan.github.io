title: All that web3 sh*t

The roadmap for understanding WTF blockchain developer is. I'm [curious](https://twitter.com/mikolasan/status/1440242044518027268) if this technology can find its application in the gambling industry.

[Vitto](https://twitter.com/VittoStack/status/1439980837899055108) wrote something about web 3. Here's my filtered version.


# Decentralized applications

[What is a Decentralized Application?](https://youtu.be/F50OrwV6Uk8)

- frontend
- Solidity/Solana backend, built on top of a blockchain

Specifically [Ethereum](https://youtube.com/watch?v=gjwr-7PgpN8) blockchain. Ethereum is software running on a network of computers that ensures the replication and processing of small programs called Smart Contracts

A Smart Contract is software stored on a blockchain-based platform, that automatically executes an agreement. It is written in Solidity, Rust, or Vyper (Solidity but in Py flavor)

[Solidity](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ) is a high-level, contract-oriented programming language to write smart contracts, allowing programmers to write self-executing code that powers blockchain DApps.


## Libraries 

Choose between two JavaScript libraries to connect to local or remote blockchain:

- [Web3.js](https://youtube.com/watch?v=t3wM5903ty0&list=PLS5SEs8ZftgXlCGXNfzKdq7nGBcIaVOdN)
- [Ethers.js](https://youtube.com/watch?v=a0osIaAOFSE)

[Truffle](https://youtube.com/watch?v=62f757RVEvU&t=172s) - a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for any EVM Blockchain. [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/overview), part of the Truffle suite, is a tool solely built to test Ethereum contracts locally.


## Tools

Remix is a Solidity IDE used to write, compile and debug Solidity code. [Contract development in Remix](https://youtu.be/p3C7jljTXaA). It has plugins.


## Projects

Here are some project ideas [rewritten from](https://ethhole.com/challenge).

### Voting

There is registration period and voting period. Anyone can register. Anyone can vote. All votes immediately visible, a vote cannot be changed. 



Very good practive for roulette/horse racing app, where also there is a period for bets and show time later.

Before writing these projects, the architecture shouold be reviewed in terms of ["Understanding and Discovering Attacks on Ethereum Decentralized Applications"](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21summer_su.pdf)
