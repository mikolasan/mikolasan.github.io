Study JavaScript, Smart Contracts, Solidity, deploy Decentralized Applications, and get paid up to $140k/year on average.

Full Web3.0 Development Roadmap.

A thread ↓

Start With the Fundamentals.
A Skyscraper needs solid foundations to not collapse.

Blockchain development it's a tough subject, I won't lie.

Before digging deeper into nodes and blocks, better start with the fundamentals of computer science:

Learn the Fundamentals of Blockchain:

As a Web3.0 developer, you need to understand what the blockchain is, how it works, and why:

you might get paid $140k/year on average.

What is a Decentralized Application?

A DApp has:

- A standard front-end
- A Solidity/Solana Backend, built on top of a blockchain

To understand how they communicate, you need to understand Front-end and Backend Development

What is a DApp?

2021 Roadmap to Front-End Development

Before delving into developing your DApp, you need to learn the basics of front-end development:

HTML & CSS -> Js-> REST -> Framework

2021 Roadmap + 15 FREE resources to kickstart your front-end journey

Should I learn Standard Backend development?
Yes and now.

Decentralized Applications backends vastly differ from "standard" applications backends, but a majority of technical principles are the same.

Study standard Backend, then move to Blockchain-based backends

2021 Roadmap to Backend development

Understand how front-end and backend exchange data:

Learn: Node, Express, DBs, HTTP, how to develop APIs, and start deploying cutting-edge applications.

Learn Ethereum

A web3.0 developer needs to understand how Ethereum works.

Ethereum is software running on a network of computers that ensures the replication and processing of small programs called Smart Contracts

Learn more about Ethereum:

Learn what Smart Contracts Are:

A Smart Contract is software stored on a blockchain-based platform, that automatically executes an agreement.

It is written in Solidity, Rust, or Vyper (Solidity but in Py flavor)

Learn about Smart Contracts:
[https://coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts](https://coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts)

Connect Your DApp Front-end: Learn Web3.js or Ethers.js

You need a way to connect your front-end with your local or remote blockchain node, using anything from HTTP to Websockets.

To do so you can choose between two JavaScript Libraries:

- Web3.js
- Ethers.js

Learn Web3.js:

web3.js is a collection of libraries that allow you to connect with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, WebSocket, and other communication protocols.

Learn Ethers.js

Ethers.js is a lightweight javascript library used as an alternative to Web3.js to build JavaScript front-end and connect them with the Ethereum blockchain.

Install Remix IDE

Remix is a Solidity IDE used to write, compile and debug Solidity code.

It fosters a fast development cycle + rich set of plugins to serve your whole Smart Contracts development journey.

Learn Solidity To Develop and Deploy Smart Contracts

Solidity is a high-level, contract-oriented programming language to write smart contracts, allowing programmers to write self-executing code that powers blockchain DApps.

Develop Your First Decentralize Applications

Learn by practicing and solving problems is key:

Start building your first DApps to reinforce your understanding of blockchain development.

Web3.0 Projects Inspirations:

Finding project ideas to showcase in your blockchain developer portfolio, might not be that intuitive.

Let me share with you 6 projects ideas to practice your web3.0 knowledge:

Speed Up Your Development With Truffle

A development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for any EVM Blockchain

It comes with:

- Built-in smart contract compilation
- Scriptable migration framework
- and more.

Learn Truffle:

Testing Your Blockchain Smart Contracts is Key.

What makes the Blockchain so special is the non-reversibility: once a block is added, it can't be edited or recalled.

This is also the reason why you should learn how to test smart contracts before deploying them.

How do I Test my DApp?

There are 4 types of testing to test your Smart Contracts:

- Node Testing
- Functional Testing
- Performance Testing
- API Testing

Learn Ganache to Test Ethereum Contracts

Ganache, part of the Truffle suite, is a tool solely built to test Ethereum contracts locally.

It creates a simulated blockchain with accounts to test your transactions.

Learn How to setup Ganache:

Conclusions:

Learning Web3.0 and blockchain development might sound daunting at first, but everyone can do it.

Learn step-by-step, develop projects, explore, and be patient.
You won't learn how to code in 1 week, but you can do it in 1 year of full commitment.

Summary:

- Fundamentals of Computer Science
- Fundamentals of Blockchain
- DApps
- Front-end development
- Backend development
- Ethereum, Smart Contracts
- Web3.js or Ethers.js
- Solidity
- Truffle and Ganache
- Testing
- Learn CI/CD and Dev Ops

Interesting roadmap of blockchain developer. I'm curious if this technology can find its application in the gambling industry.

Also worth mentioning decentralized websites by [http://zeronet.io](http://zeronet.io/) - new way of web browsing.
