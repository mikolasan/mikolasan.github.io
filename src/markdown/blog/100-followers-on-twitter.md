This is typical me. It’s happening so slow that I don’t know when the milestone does occur. If it had happened the next day when I registered my account I would definitely be surprised but I would celebrate it. But when the number increments by one in a period of weeks or month, then it’s like playing drums, where the next beat is going to be only tomorrow. No music.

I don’t feel it, that’s why I do not know when I need to mark a milestone. And that is sad. So how do you do that? Dress in fancy clothes, reserve a table in restaurant, blow out candles on a cake, post a silly gif?

I guess it’s a milestone anyway. I did some good content, I tried to give good advice, all the best to my knowledge. I created my timeline with my own style: things about games, ideas and DIY, no politics, or hatred, or memes, only personal experience of a software developer. Sometimes boring, sometimes fun.

As [John Carmack said](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1530022921615327240): connecting people is one of the most powerful things that technology can do!

I love you all and I love bots too.
