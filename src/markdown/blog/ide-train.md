You will be more productive using better tools. So, what is your IDE and how you are satisfied with it?

I will tell you how many tools I have tried before.

Back in the day I was using proprietary IDEs licensed by my university. I used **C++ Builder** (Embarcadero RAD Studio nowadays) and **Visual Studio**. Not complicated university projects on Windows. It was more than enough.

Then Iâ€™ve got a job where special IDE was used. Okay, "special" is too much here, just vanilla qscintilla with search functionality. It was even nowhere close to **ZeroBrane Studio**. At some point (after 2 or 3 years ðŸ˜²) I realized that I will be more productive using better tools.

No, just kidding. I was not that smart ðŸ˜‚ So happened that it was time to start a new project in C++. My previous experience with **Qt Creator** and **Code::Blocks** was not satisfying. I also tried **Emacs**, but was not able to run a debugger from it. So I have started searching.

I had the following criteria. It should

- have a nice interface (dark theme)
- work on Linux
- be free
- support many languages (highlighting)
- have autocomplete and code snippets

Almost no choice. And I install **Atom** ðŸ˜±

Why not **VS Code**? Because it looked like a text editor that Microsoft removed from Visual Studio just to have a mark against "yes, we support Linux".

Only now I prefer VS Code over Atom. But if you never tried Atom you do not know what is a comfortable search across all project files (Ctrl+Shift+F).
