When I found out there was a popular platform where people share open source projects, I imagined GitHub differently.

I thought I could find a club of like-minded people where I could learn and try myself at something.  It seemed to me that if a person has some idea, some desire to translate into code, to create a useful program, then they would go to GitHub, create a project there, and people, who would like this idea too, will found each other very quickly. That's how I envisioned this platform.

People will start writing small pieces of code, each making a little effort, so that in the end there will be time to discuss perfect implementations and solve old problems instead of resorting to workarounds. And if the code doesn't work in any way, you won't have to sit up all night long with a debugger and be absolutely perplexed about what's going wrong, because all you have to do is ask the community.

There will be someone who understands what went wrong and he will describe in detail what commands to run, what libraries to install. Even if you need to reinstall or upgrade the OS, and for some reason you don't want to, he would explain how to workaround that.  
It would be sad to think that this person has spent many nights figuring this out before you and is now sharing his advice for free. No, he probably just knows. After all, that's what happens with experience.

And so together you would be able to handle a project of any complexity very quickly. The idea of a GitHub was a very great idea. 

But the way I described it, it never happened to me.
