Some of my best decisions:

- learn C (gives understanding of stack, heap, and memory management)
- learn git (no joke, I was taught at my first job, but before I was copying folders for that purpose, believe me, itâ€™s a mess)
- learn assembler (it helps with reverse engineering, but don't ask me when you need this skill)
- try not to google, try to remember at least the basics (read from file, write to file, find in array, ...)

### Software essentials

- Debian - server OS. No other questions asked.
- Ubuntu - developer's OS. Choose LTS versions, upgrade with full reinstall.
- docker, Jenkins - automated build system (also present in GitLab, but I didn't start the migration yet)
- GitLab self-hosted (no BitBucket or GitHub) - git version control system.
- Redmine (no Jira) - issue tracker. Install [this theme](https://github.com/mrliptontea/PurpleMine2) - it will look almost like Jira
- Confluence (?) - knowledge base. Redmine is very limited, though it has simple wiki pages
- Zulip (no slack, no discord) - quick communication, file and code sharing system. Or IRC?
