title: Software engineer roadmap
---

Some of my best decisions:

- learn assembler (it helps with reverse engineering)
- learn C (gives understanding of stack, heap, and memory management)
- learn git (no joke, I was taught at my first job, but before I was copying folders for that purposeâ€”believe me itâ€™s a mess)
- try not to google, try to remember at least the basics (read from file, write to file, find in array, )
