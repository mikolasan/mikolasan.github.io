Hmm, I will go through this questionnaire.

![ChatGPT4 questionnaire for writing a novel](./i-want-to-write-a-novel.png)

## 1. Genre

One of my favorite authors is Howard Philip Lovecraft. He writes horror, but I will go with mystery, because I want my characters to keep sanity (all Lovecraft's protagonists end up in madhouse

Not that I'm good at writing, but maybe in the future I will find this plan and confirm if I still want to write such story

## 2. Target audience

I would write for young adults. That age when you might study in a university and when you are looking for true love. When everyone around you is a braggart liar, and you are trying to find a job that will make this world better

## 3. Primary theme

Primary theme? This is hard. Can I just write? I like the sound of my keyboard. Okay, just kidding.
My main message will be YOLO. Don't look back. Live the life that you enjoy.

## 4. Plot

Approximate plot idea.

Our main protagonist is a guy who studies at the university and falls in love with a girl from his class. But he doesn't tell her about it.

One day she disappears, and the guy finds the courage to ask around. But unexpectedly, people who knew her began revealing strange facts about her life. Some secret project she was conducting at night. A bit of mystery, a bit of conspiracy...
