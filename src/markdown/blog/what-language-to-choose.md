I have heard this question many times. People usually ask me, what programming language should they start learning. They have an intention to be a programmer, but in their vision, they have to make the first hard choice in their life: to choose one language out of dozens existing nowadays.Â  

As they are my coworkers and friends I care about their carrier and recommend languages that will give them benefit on their current job and maybe in the future at new place. I am operating with a list of 5 languages that stay popular across employers for many years: Java, C#, C++, Python, JavaScript. 

Although PHP still a big thing in corporate world, I am preconceived about it and it goes out of my chart without a doubt.

Instead of Java I would like to recommend Kotlin, Scala and Clojure.
