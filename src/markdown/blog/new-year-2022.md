Happy New Year everyone! I hope 2021 was full of great achievements and I wish 2022 to be a new step in your growth 


## What was not so good in 2021

I’ve read many mean comments under my YouTube video. Probably because of this and absence of a good mic, I stopped publishing new videos. 

I haven’t tried any new programming language in 2021. All my investments went negative. My visa and future work is under big question. I have started to doubt my startup idea and my ability to make a prototype.


## What new skills I have acquired

- Running 5k in less than 30 minutes with ease. 
- I get some experience with milling cutter and finished Adirondack chair.
- I tried new features from new C++ standards (11, 14, 17) and can write simple CMake build configuration without googling.
- And I barely touched cryptocurrency technology, but surely I will continue digging in and writing about web3 from a normal person perspective.


## What I have achieved

I worked this year remotely for the same company that I joined 9 years ago. For tax purposes I registered my own company and now they are my first client. 
I cannot say that I learned CSS, I was just trying my best to make my website that looks okay on mobile as well as on desktop. I used !important few times this year. I started my website as an online resume, but then I found myself motivated to write down notes about my work and game development. Even though my website exists in the abyss, but I will continue writing because the site works well as a personal knowledge base. Also my content is unsystematic and navigation is bad, but I will address this in this year.

In December I wanted to have at least one thing finished, but instead I went for a long vacation. Hopefully it will be the beginning of a good story, but I can only tell you about it later. Anyway I have big ambitions for this year.
So no matter what you are planning to do in 2022 like make a game or build a startup, let’s make it happen!
