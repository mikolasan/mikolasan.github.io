Andrew Male in [his Twitter asked](https://twitter.com/andym84/status/1521733648051052546?s=12):

> If anyone is bored and into robotics, I need one that will sit on my desk and when it sees me reading code for more than an hour it will ask me out loud if I really need to refactor the code.

As you [may know](/about), I am a huge robotics enthusiast. I [decided to start](https://twitter.com/mikolasan/status/1533941270594277376) simple. Robot-companion

- it is sitting on your desk and monitors you
- it plans and organizes your work
- if you stuck on social media website, it will tell you get back to work
- and the opposite, it reminds when to do a break.

Plus a screen with emotion expressions and wheels to poke around on the table and find a charger station when needed.

So itâ€™s like a coach. It should pose an angry reaction when you are out of track in your plan.

I'm aiming for a physical device. It will sit on a desk - a physical table where my laptop is.
