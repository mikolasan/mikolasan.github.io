title: Blog Launch Plan
---

I found a Blog Launch Plan on Pinterest.
It is titled as "What to do in your first month".
So it has 31 items with 1 to 3 hours required for each task.
For some tasks time assigned is way too optimistic, but I want to finish in one Saturday's morning.

### Decide if blogging is right for you.

No. Blogging is definitely not about me. Next.

### Set big goals with realistic expectations.

My website sited on Wikipedia.
A neon sign on a skyscraper is displaying my website name. In that building a big team of editors is writing articles about innovative experiments executed by our R&D team.

**Find your passions.** Passions?

> an extreme interest in or wish for doing something, such as a hobby, activity, etc.

*Cambridge Dictionary https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/passion*

I have extreme interest in doing many things, but in reality I usually lie on a sofa dreaming about these things. Why are you asking about passions?

**Decide on a profitable blog niche that align with your passions.** Furniture making, pillows?

Actually I'm into software development, artificial intelligence, electronics, and design. So slick devices and intellectual apps.

**Decide on a blog name.** That is the hardest task so far. I did prepare for this one before diving into the list, because it took me many hours of searching and tasting (yes, taste your name). I'll tell a good generator for this task https://namelix.com/

- Bamboozlar
- Hightech Knight

It's also worth mentioning a generator for almost everything https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/

- Black Yak Studio
- Grumpy Mushroom

I'm not going to reveal my name, because domain name is not purchased yet.

**Purchase your domain name, sign up for hosting and install Wordpress.** No. Sign up for GitHub, install Gatsby (static site generator) and use GitHub pages.

**Customize your blog.** It took me many days to make something decent.

- My own CSS, no frameworks, only snippets from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/
- Responsible. After every change in layout you resize your browser to test it for tablets and phones.
