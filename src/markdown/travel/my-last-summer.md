Daytime in Novosibirsk is extremely long. The Sun comes out early as 4am, but as night person I wake up between 9 and 11am. If I go out of bed at 9, then I drink coffee, check social, post something and at 10 Iâ€™m ready to work. What it means for me is that I change the pants and go to another room. As an entrepreneur that has a contract with a foreign company all my work happens at home. So first thing in the morning I check Slack, email and the issue tracker
We used the issue tracker before, but without a dedicated manager it is easy between programmers to communicate in Slack and track current tasks in your personal notes. I use Trello for that. Some notes I delete when they are done, but other cards become a storage of important information. In another words Trello is my personal knowledge base.
