Last good vacation was snowboarding at Thanksgiving on Big Bear Lake. But that was 2019. If not counting 4-day winter fishing on last year, then I didn’t take vacation in years! Because of many circumstances, this year it’s going to be very spontaneous trip to Mauritius.
Btw that day I’ve finished 101 course of snowboarding, was practicing for 2 hours and then realized that my pants are not snow pants and that while I was sitting on snow they already absorbed a pint of water. And I need to walk to the cabin for more than 30 minutes.

Twitter needs to hear this: my job in software development company allowed me to go on vacation to the place that my wife dreamed for honeymoon.

Today is very important day that will determine my life for the next few years and probably the rest of my life. A little nervous 

So we went to an interview in US Consulate in Mauritius. We think that it was okay, but according to our current situation it was not near to that. They either want to find correct words to reject our visas (I bet it’s hard when the petition have been approved), or they want to inspect our intention expecting us to surrender (to leave holiday island with 24 hour long flights to our home, thus we will not go back)

## Epilogue

Today, after 3 weeks off, my first thought about programming was: this is going to be boring. And while I was reviewing my backlog for the next month I did few calls (and finally found a place where I can buy a vacuum meter!). So in the end when I had a picture of what I’m going to do this week and the next week, I’ve found myself interested in programming again. So weird feeling I must say
