## Profile

I enjoy when the code is written well and it looks perfect.
After more than 7 years of work with code of different quality I'm noticing a beauty in some projects and appreciate creators behind it.
At the same time I realize that it is almost impossible in a real world.
All the struggles behind the project do not matter if it is shipped in time and serves the buisness goal well.

I’m a professional software developer with strong mathematics and programming background, over 7 years of experience in the field of gambling industry such as game development, casino systems and equipment, calculating PAR sheets.
