An add-on for Firefox for automatically sorting bookmarks using neural networks (or another approach from the field of artificial intelligence).

Instead of manually sorting bookmarks, this add-on could employ a neural network to analyze your browsing habits, content preferences, and the frequency of visits to different websites.
The neural network classifies bookmarks based on the content of the websites. For instance, it might recognize and group together bookmarks related to news, tech, entertainment, or any custom categories you define.
As your browsing habits evolve, the neural network continuously adapts its categorization algorithm, it learns from your interactions.

The AI analysis is conducted locally on the user's machine, without transmitting any personal data.

This add-on could save users time and effort, offering a dynamic and intelligent way to keep their bookmarks organized based on their unique preferences and behaviors.

What do you think about this approach?
