# AI-powered news feed

First name that I come up with was "AI powered news feed". Because there is an AI system and it works with news feed. But there is a problem in interpretation. One can think that news feed is created by AI, where created means written, like instead of using real flash and bone journalists these news are composed by artificial brains. And even more sinister scenario: what if this AI system writes [fake news](/ideas/web-app/fake-news) to sow doubt in its way to total dominance over humanity.

But my original idea was not about AI writerâ€”only an orginizer of already existing news. "Feed" is very important keyword there, because it relates to the form of how we percieve information nowadays. We scroll through a feed of articles consuming disturbing titles and short descriptions fullfilling them by a cover photo. And as soon as the feed become irrelevant to our mood, we stop scrolling and close the app.

No one wants that: from our side we want to procrastinate further, and the app creators want that we continue using the app, because that way they will show more ads and make nmore money. This may be raises another deep problem that the app creators don't care about credibility and verification. But we leave it for now. Let's go back to the meaning of "AI powered news feed".

So the idea behind "AI powered news feed" is simple recommendation system.

# Recommendation system

TODO :)

I wanted to try writing a web app using Python. So I chose Django
