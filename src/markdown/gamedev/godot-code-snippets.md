Long time I wanted to try making slides with code snippets. This is just a quick (1h 30min) sketch. Of course I have all code [published online](https://neupokoev-n.gitbook.io/godot-patterns/), but I believe such format is popular on social media.

> Technically a good idea but everything in this picture screams for consistent color use. The background Colors clash A LOT with the syntax Colors and both donâ€™t work really well with the pixel art style of the Godot logo

Mix and match of styles is my problem. I'll work on that. The logo actually started its position behind "Godot" text, but then I decided to balance out the composition ðŸ™‚ I might do some slight robo contours on the background instead.

Maybe I should try to take [code snapshots in Godot](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.code-snapshot) with the plugin.
