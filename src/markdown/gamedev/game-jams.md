I like jams. But I never win them.

I have participated in several game jams:

- [Repl.it Game Jam](https://repl.it/talk/challenge/Were-hosting-a-Game-Jam/11432)
- [Mega Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/2020-epic-megajam)
- [AI and Games 2021](https://itch.io/jam/aiandgames-2021)

Only one of them was submitted https://replit.com/@stakanmartini/test-roguelike-11. Read longer story [on its page](/gamedev/pyroguelike).
