title: Racing with serious stakes
---

For fun esport you need a team of engineers who is under control of the environment: they design moving mechanisms, weather conditions. Also they provide a proof that the track is doable. Racers donâ€™t know about the track before the race starts. And of course what esport game without other people betting who is gonna survive and come first. If a car goes down by a challenge created by engineers, then bets made on that car go (partly) to the engineers.
