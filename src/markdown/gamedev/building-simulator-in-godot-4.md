The basics will be based on First Person Shooter template. Some that I was considering:
- [From chaffgames](https://github.com/chafmere/Godot4-FPS-Template.git) ([docs](https://docs.chaffgames.com/docs/fpstemplate/creating_a_new_weapon/)) - weapon change animation, projectiles, HUD
- [First Person Starter](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/424) by Whimfoome ([github]()) - no weapons, very slippery
- [Starter Kit FPS](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2208) by Kenney ([github](https://github.com/KenneyNL/Starter-Kit-FPS)) - double jump, weapons have recoil, enemies
