Jamming gives very unique feeling that I've never had at work.
After thorough planning on paper and in Confluence I tirelessly code and code and code.
No questions, no meetings, no watercooler breaks. Ideal life ü¶Ñ

## #1 Evening brainstorm üçµ 

- search for jams in progress when a 3-day weekend is ahead
- find out a theme
- make a cup of tea
- think about simple and fun mechanics
- then go to sleep, write code tomorrow
- if you don‚Äôt have ideas even after the second cup of tea, then you are not going to sleep today. Think better brain!

## #2 Finish it at any cost

- cut the scope

## #3 Get your environment ready

Check that you have all tools installed

- Krita
- GIMP
- Inkscape
- Soundly
- LMMS
- Godot 3.4.4.stable

Installed? Then you are ready to jam!
