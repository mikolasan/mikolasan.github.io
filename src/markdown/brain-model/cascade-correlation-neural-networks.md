## Neural networks with biologically plausible accounts of neurogenesis

they start with a minimal topology (just input and output unit) and recruit new hidden units as learning progresses

but are there popular neural network algorithms that start with a minimal topology and recruit new hidden units, and update network weights in a neurobiologically plausible manner?
