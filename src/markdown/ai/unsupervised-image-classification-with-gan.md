After [playing with CycleGAN](/science/cycle-gan-intro), I [started wondering](/devlog/14) if [Generative Adversarial Networks](/ai/generative-adversarial-networks) (GANs) can be trained without labels on small datasets and their discriminator part would work as classificator. I found one [notebook](https://github.com/sthalles/blog-resources/blob/master/semi-supervised/semi-supervised_learning.ipynb) that follows this path.
