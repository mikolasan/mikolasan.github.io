## Resources

- [Tips and tricks to make GANs work](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks)
- [Deep Convolution GAN](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html). Agile? Sentient? Quantum?
- real math [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08244.pdf) with Lebesgue measure, Sobolev spaces

- combine different GANs together [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07536.pdf)
- maybe I'll want to spend my time on [style transfer](https://harishnarayanan.org/writing/artistic-style-transfer/) in the end
