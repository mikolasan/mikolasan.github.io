[The Cart Pole problem](http://www.derongliu.org/adp/adp-cdrom/Barto1983.pdf) was introduced by A.G. Barto, R.S. Sutton, and C.W. Anderson in "Neuronlike adaptive elements that
can solve difficult learning control problems". [Usually](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/reinforcement_learning/actor_critic) it's solved by [Reinforcment Learning](/ai/reinforcement-learning)



Sutton and Burto wrote [the whole book](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/assets/files/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) about Reinforcment Learning, so no wonder why their problem is solved this way, but today we will use [Spiking Neural Networks](/ai/spiking-neural-networks) to achieve one-shot learning and smooth movements

There's [an environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) where different implementations can be compared and scored (?). But the same as in original computer simulation from the paper the gym only allows to push the cart with constant force, but at any time interval. Controlling the amount of force will be our second goal.

## Design the network


1. The graph is not fully connected
2. Connections defined randomly and never change (presence of the connection, not its strength)
3. Simultaneous connections to layers deep inside the network
4. Feedback connections making closed loops

> In the adult rat, 80% of parallel fiber terminals occur on dendritic spines, 9% contact dendritic shafts, and approximately 11% do not have a postsynaptic partner. 
> Moreover, 20% of terminals can be shared by two dendritic spines.
