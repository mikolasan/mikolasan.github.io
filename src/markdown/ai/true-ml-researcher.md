Maybe you have a job position as a data scientist or ML researcher, but you cannot be called that way if you cannot answer the following simple questions.

1. What is the minimal Artificial Neural network configuration to learn the sine function on the whole range of real values?
2. How gradient descent method changes convolution kernels?
3. For training purposes activation functions must be differentiable. What method we can use if the activation function is not differentiable and give an example of such function.
4. How to measure amount of information stored in ANN?
5. How to find synonyms with LLMs?


## Answers

Might be an answer on how to train ANN on a period of the sin function the way that it can properly extrapolate outside of the training boundaries: [Neural Networks Fail to Learn Periodic Functions and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08195)
