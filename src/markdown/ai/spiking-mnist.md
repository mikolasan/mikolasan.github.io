### How numbers and quantities are represented in neural ensembles?

**Place Value and Population Coding** The dominant theory is that numerical magnitude is represented through population coding in ensembles of "number neurons." These neurons have tuned responses to specific numerical ranges, with overlapping tuning curves that create a distributed representation. Individual neurons fire maximally for their preferred numerosity but also respond (with decreasing intensity) to nearby values.

**Key Brain Regions** The intraparietal sulcus (IPS), particularly the horizontal segment, shows robust activation for numerical processing across different formats (dots, digits, number words). Single-cell recordings in monkeys have identified neurons that respond selectively to specific numerosities, independent of other visual features like size or density.

**Approximate Number System (ANS)** This system represents numerical magnitude in an analog, approximate manner following Weber's law - discrimination becomes harder as numbers get larger. The neural representation appears to be logarithmically compressed, similar to other magnitude representations in the brain.

**Experimental Evidence** Research using fMRI adaptation paradigms shows that repeated presentation of the same numerosity leads to decreased activation, while changing numerosity causes recovery of the signal. The degree of recovery correlates with numerical distance, supporting the idea of overlapping tuning curves.

**Symbolic vs. Non-symbolic Processing** There's evidence for partially distinct neural pathways for exact symbolic numbers (like "7") versus approximate quantities (like a collection of dots), though they share common magnitude representation areas.

**Neural Oscillations** Recent work suggests that different frequency bands in neural oscillations may encode different aspects of numerical information, with gamma oscillations potentially important for precise numerical computations.
