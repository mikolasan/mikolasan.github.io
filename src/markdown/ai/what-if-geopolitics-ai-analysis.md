## Idea

I want to create an AI system that would be able to answer theoretical questions about big geopolitical changes. For example

What if Russia will join European Union? Will it add only european part splitting Russia into parts and seperating asian part as an independent state?

The system that knows about underlying causes and connections between countries and alliences.

## Research

Generate more info, ask questions (**logical reasoning**)

> Combining research in hint related education and learning research, a few general rules for hint design could be summarized. For example, a typical design of the hint should not directly explain the intended concept in full, but partially suggest the concept with pieces of indirect but practical information. Moreover, common usage of the hints is through a series of logical deductions exhausting all possible hints in combination with the knowledge learned to arrive at the most likely concept in question, which is similar to human deductive reasoning from known clues.

**Abductive learning**; logic level affects neural network
