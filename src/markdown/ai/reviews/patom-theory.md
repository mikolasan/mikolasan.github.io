[Pattern-atom (patom) theory](https://medium.com/pat-inc/brains-are-not-prediction-machines-a6983b04bc52) = brain is a pattern matching machine.

Seems like very stubborn and contradicting approach. It assumes that brain is a memory only device, no way of processing and computing. It only stores patterns. Learning is retrieving old patterns, altering them and storing new versions. Other things like processing mathematical theorems only exist in your imagination. Or it’s very complex pattern that was iterated over many many times that it snowballed into one big hierarchical “pattern”. It also totally misses transfer learning, when some knowledge can be transferred in another domain using analogies. That’s is definitely the opposite of matching.
