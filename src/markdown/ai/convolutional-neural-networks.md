## Main questions

### How does a convolution kernel get trained?

2D convolution is [a matrix-matrix multiplication](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16798888/2-d-convolution-as-a-matrix-matrix-multiplication). See [here](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/11172/how-can-the-convolution-operation-be-implemented-as-a-matrix-multiplication) with pictures and formulas.
