Do you know how hard to find a decent 3D model of Arduino case in 2021? Very hard. It apparently was [a thing in 2014](https://extrasensoryobjects.wordpress.com/2014/09/15/test-print-with-new-3d-printer/), but many models today are unavailable. 
After 30 minutes of searching on Thingeverse here is my list of Arduino cases that I would call "not bad":

- Nice honeycomb pattern https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/64178-mount-for-arduino-uno-with-motor-shield
- Sliding lid design https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-arduino-uno-case-85771
- Stylish thing based on very popular Raspberry case https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4362300
- Should fit really well, but attractive only if printed with bright colors https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:628929

And here is the best [pick](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2511299) today.

## Bonus

[A Minecraft themed box](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4735186) for god-knows-what that can fit inside.
