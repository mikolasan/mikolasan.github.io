A new spin to my strange purchase of 5 servo drives. Why strange? Because 5 servos is not enough to make a spider (a hexapod robot).

This time I want to create an arm. 5 servos should be enough for one robot arm.

## Moodboard

Here is my refernce:

## Main beginner questions

- acrilic or plywood or ABS?
- in another words: laser cut or 3d print?
- joints. at least I know, that they should be rigid (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2727176) not pulled be lines (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3105948)
