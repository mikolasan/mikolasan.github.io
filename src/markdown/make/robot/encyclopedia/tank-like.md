SMARS [version 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2662828), [version 4 (lite)](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/smars-v4-lite) created by [Kevin Thomas](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Tuitxy/3d-models).

I originally saved a link to **Cults 3D** where I saw similar interface to **Thingeverse** and the download button. But that doen't allow you to take the files. And then I noticed that in one year the creator has made 3000 euro selling this model by 5 euro for the zip. Looks like a good business model for hobby. 

But I'm a guy from Soviet Union, which means I am okay to spend some time and create my own version, because engineering is in my blood. Here's helpful [design walkthrough](https://www.smarsfan.com/learn/design/) from Kevin McAleer.
