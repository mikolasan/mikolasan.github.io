## Plans for version 2

- battery level indicator (LCD + DAC converter)
- 130 Ohm resistors for LEDs instead of 470 Ohm
- optional remote charger
- get power straight from PSU when in charge mode (something like [TPS2113](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps2113.pdf))
- add to power board logic level 3.3V
- brushless DC motors
