What eco-friendly robot differs from others?

- Such robots can use renewable or alternative sources of energy, such as solar power, biofuel, or organic matter
- A robot that can sort, collect, or process waste materials and turn them into useful products or energy
- A robot that can perform agricultural tasks such as pruning, picking, or planting crops. This can  minimize the use of fertilizers and pesticides.


The robot's primary function will be to assist users in managing their daily tasks, reminders, and communication needs, but with an added focus on eco-consciousness. The robot will have various attachment points for users to add and customize different modules such as sensors, actuators, mini-gardens, air quality monitors, or even smart home control modules = modular

The robot can provide gardening tips and reminders for planting, watering, and maintaining a sustainable garden. It can suggest recipes from local plant-based ingredients.

It will offer real-time feedback and motivation to help users achieve their goals.

Good examples:

- **Customizable (programmability)**, people will spend time creating their modules, extensions, versions. Like Arduino or Raspberry Pi which is just a platform or dog-like robots
- New functionality that is also hackable. Like Flipper Zero has a radio transmitter
- Cute face with emotions and reactions. Like Tamagotchi, M5 Stack. _It can show notifications with special mimics._
- Solves one task well. Tracks your tasks, shows reminders, records and transcribes conversations,
- Resembles current trends. Like dog robots.

Bad examples:

- requires another boards
- big size, bulky design
- fixed single configuration


- How can I build my own eco-friendly robot?
- What are the challenges of creating a robot that will grow and propagate plants indoors in regular homes and apartments in a space not bigger than a desk?
- What are some challenges of selling eco-friendly robots?
- What are some future trends in eco-friendly robotics?

 It might be the case that consumers were less likely to buy a "green" product if they perceived it as less effective or less attractive than a conventional product.
