### Minecraft version

> I did this as a winter holiday break project. The server itself has been running since around February and has kind of kept me sane this year. I designed the whole thing in CAD myself over a few days with some prototyping of the board mounts. The outer case is laser cut plywood. There is an inner layer of laser cut acrylic sheets to act as light diffusers and hide the inside, the rear panel is the same, just without any scuffing on it. The actual board mounts and bottom of the case are 3D printed. The outer layer and rear panel could be 3D printed. The lighting is a cheap RGB LED set from Five Below.
