## Prologue

2021-01-20. I came back to Russia previous year in October, and I noticed that people do not have enough fresh produce of good quality.
And one part is really obvious that transportation from the farm to the warehouse to the store cannot be ideal and fresh tropical vegetables/fruit can be exposed to really cold weather. Especially green leaves like salad, parsley, dill etc.

## Updates

I built a thing today! Next will be piping
