Design a robot in three easy steps:

- [3d print](/make/3d-printer-dilemma)
- [buy components](/make/where-to-buy-electronic-components-in-us)
- assemble

mu-ha-ha in reality you need a little bit more steps

But it all starts [with a tweet](/blog/robot-coach).

## The look

It can start as deep as [some research about robot appearance](/make/robot/appearance-design), but of course it should start with understanding if we create good robot or either evil robot.

## Electrical components

- [Power board](/make/robot/power-board)
- [Motor board](/make/robot/motor-board)
- [Review](/make/robot/first-review)
- [PCB design 101](/make/robot/pcb-design-101)

## Prototype

Before really doing [version 1](/make/robot/prototype-1) I plan to look closer into targeting it in a near feature as a board for making an [Arduino-based drone](/make/robot/arduino-drone) and flexible for [constructor kit](/make/robot/constructor) purposes
