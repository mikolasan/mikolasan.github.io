Andrew Male in [his Twitter asked](https://twitter.com/andym84/status/1521733648051052546?s=12):

> If anyone is bored and into robotics, I need one that will sit on my desk and when it sees me reading code for more than an hour it will ask me out loud if I really need to refactor the code.

As you [may know](/about), I am up to robotics. I [decided to start](https://twitter.com/mikolasan/status/1533941270594277376) simple. Robot-companion

- it is sitting on your desk and monitors you
- it plans and organizes your work
- if you stuck on social media website, it will tell you get back to work
- and the opposite, it reminds when to do a break.

Plus a screen with emotion expressions and wheels to poke around on the table and find a charger station when needed.

So itâ€™s like a coach. It should pose an angry reaction when you are out of track in your plan.

I'm aiming for a physical device. It will sit on a desk - a physical table where my laptop is. 

### Tank-like robot

Like SMARS [version 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2662828), [version 4 (lite)](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/smars-v4-lite) created by [Kevin Thomas](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Tuitxy/creations?page=2).

![smars v4](./smars-v4.jpg)

I originally saved a link to **Cults 3D** where I saw similar interface to **Thingeverse** and the download button. But that doen't allow you to take the files. And then I noticed that in one year the creator has made 3000 euro selling this model by 5 euro for the zip. Looks like a good business model for hobby. 

But I'm a guy from Soviet Union, which means I am okay to spend some time and create my own version, because engineering is in my blood.

## 3D model description

> This new version of SMARS is reduced to the essential.
> The chassis has been eliminated to reduce printing time, motion system is an updated version of the pro tracks model, it gives smooth and precise movement.
> This model moved the trade off between modularity and flexibility to another level, 
> SMARS V4 lite is Arduino based but can easily mount Raspberry PI 3B/ 4B or a Microbit by adding a simple adapter.

### Chassis

**Silicone wristbands** can be used as tracks. Such solution gives an incredible grip to the robot and a more fluid motion due to the bearings system.

**Mecanum wheel** (ilon wheels) [hack](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:434760). If you put 4 motors in the robot, thus one motor for each wheel, then you can unlock benefits of mecanum wheels:

- no need to turn wheels
- moving straight, sideway, diagonal
- turning araound one wheel, its center, one of the wheel axis

*Note:* If the robot gets stuck, the transmission should automatically decouple the wheel from the motor shaft preventing current peaks. This will avoid damages to motors or electronics controller.

## 3D printing
