# Assembly

Here it is

![1](./prusa-original-mini-assembly-1.jpg)

This is gonna be fun, right?

Starting with the first bag.

When I assemble a wardrobe or a desk I can figure out all nuts and bolts without a manual, but this kit is intimidating.

Reading every step very carefully. Just enjoying the process 😊

Somewhere halfway through with the bottom platform. Slow progress, call it a night 😴

I’m at the step where I need to eat a couple of gummy bears

By looking at this PCB and stylish brown silkscreen, by touching the smooth matte surface I was reminded that there are still companies that care about quality of each component. Even invisible ones.

1-to-1 sized cheatsheet is very helpful

They use nylon nuts in some places to fight with vibration I guess. Will see if I need to tighten anything up after many prints

Can you get this emotion? Is it astonishment, indignation or concentration?

Just don’t tell me that I’ll need to do cable management

I don’t know what this means, but it looks cool

> It says shaken but not stirred

Last check before hiding the mess

Almost done, no more bags with screws. Should be ready for its first calibration tomorrow. If I will be lucky, then also some test print.

What’s funny that this night I had a dream where I followed a step by step tutorial similar to what I used in the last 3 evenings. But in the dream that tutorial was explaining how to hide a treasure and put future treasure hunters on a false track 😆

I successfully finished the assembly of my first 3d printer. It was really fun. Now I know a little bit about moving mechanisms on smooth rods and aluminum profiles

Test print in progress. I still don’t understand why it poops before the start and after, and if this is normal. Also I needed to calibrate it during the print (good, that there’s live adjustment of Z axis)
