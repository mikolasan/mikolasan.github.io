## Warping, curling

If the "vase" touches only with narrow edge the heated bed, and it grows with controlled overhangsâ€”they can warp because less tempereture is transfered from the base.

If the bottom layer warps and the object pops up from the bed, then increase bed temperature, first layer height, add brim.

What if the brim flies out itself? (brim curling) Then the print head is too close to the bed or it's overextruding.


## Stringing

Increase retraction (5mm distance), lower nozzle temperature (200C PLA)
