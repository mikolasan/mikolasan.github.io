## From Ali

- [Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor](/make/capacitive-soil-moisture-sensor)
- [TFT Display Module](/make/tft-display-module-st7789v)


## Wishlist

- [T-Deck](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-deck) - Blackbery / Nokia clone
- [T-Display](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3-amoled) - Juicy display, favourite toy of [@Sulfuroid](https://twitter.com/sulfuroid)


## Dumpster dive

- DAGU robot MINI DC gearbox DG01D 48:1
- Lithium Poli Battery 3.7V 1300mAh
- [Qwiic motor driver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15451) (1.5 A peak drive per channel, 1.2 A steady state, Operates from 3 to 11 Volts with 12V absolute max, 3.3V default VCC and logic, Controllable by I2C or TTL UART signals) based on DRV8835. Similar chip [I reveiwed already](/make/robot/motor-controller-board)
- [Pi Servo Hat](/make/servo-hat-for-raspberry-pi). 16 PWM channels, controllable over I2C
- [Accelerometer and gyroscope](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18020). I2C, 3.3V operating voltage
- Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors are great for detecting motion in a small area around the sensor. 
- [MicroMod MikroBUS Carrier Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18710) - I also mention it in my [power board](/make/robot/power-board) development notes. equipped with a MCP73831 Single-Cell Lithium-Ion/Lithium-Polymer Charge IC. It receives power from the USB connection and can source up to 450mA to charge an attached battery. Plus 3.3V 1A Voltage
