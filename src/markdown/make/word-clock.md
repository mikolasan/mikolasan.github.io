I followed instructions from Make magazine (Volume 67) and made word clock.

I also started a [code project](https://repl.it/@stakanmartini/WordClock#main.cpp) discovering ways to combine words into a grid.

## Why

It will stay on the table and will show time when I need to head out of the office.

## Process

Ordered laser cut, bought screws and adafruit boards.

How do you call screen that does not display time with digits, but tells it with words?

## Result

The clock is working. I will edit video of the process soon.
