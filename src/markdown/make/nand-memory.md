_From a letter where a try to find a datasheet_

I represent <>, a company specializing in the upcycling of used electronics.

We're currently working on a project that involves the use of NAND Memory chips, particularly the **H25BFT8A1B8R** model. However, we are facing challenges in locating the datasheet for this specific chip online, and we suspect it might be marked as an end-of-life product.

Best regards
