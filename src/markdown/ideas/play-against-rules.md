Think about card game similar to Munchkin where every card describes a situation, but every time you need to make a decision: follow the rules or play against them. Breaking rules leads you to the top of the leaderboard, but consumes your life power, which means you cannot be contra every time, you need to collect and utilize special loot that will keep your power intact.
