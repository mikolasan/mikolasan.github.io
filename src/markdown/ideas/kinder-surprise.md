So, everyone loves gifts. Expensive gadgets are nice, but we also enjoy inexpensive ones if they bring utility and comfort. An example could be anything you’ve been missing in daily life: from a bookmark to a [desk lamp](/make/3d-prints/ufo-lamp). But what kinds of things can spark **renewed** interest? Some things are just mundane.

I’m especially fascinated by [construction sets](/make/constructor), [puzzles](/ideas/capture-the-flag), and [board games](/blog/clue-review-and-ideas). And what the Kinder eggs and treasure boxes used to offer us were mini construction kits made up of scattered parts and instructions.

Following instructions might seem trivial and the opposite of solving riddles, but if the construction kit includes a set of components that allows assembling completely different models, then there’s room for imagination — and that’s comparable to solving puzzles.
