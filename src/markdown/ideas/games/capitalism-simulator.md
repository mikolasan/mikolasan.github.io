Capitalism simulation game/educational app idea. 

It simulates trade, bank systems, inflation, demographic changes and such. Itâ€™s hard to display the whole world on a small mobile screen, so instead the whole screen is one country at a time. The user can swipe to another country, but while he or she is on the screen, they have to make a decision about current country and then switch to the next one.
