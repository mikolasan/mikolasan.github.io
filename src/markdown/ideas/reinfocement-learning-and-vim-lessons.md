I want to create a system that will help people to learn vim. One thing is that users need to know about available plugins that de facto are essential for comfortable code writing. The system will have a few components: [speech recognition](/ai/voice-recognition-ai-model) for receiving voice commands, natural language processing for understanding these commands and formulating answers, and [reinforcement learning](/ai/reinforcement-learning) for getting knowledge about vim.
