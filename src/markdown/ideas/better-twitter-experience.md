## Problems with current UI

- infinite timeline makes it easy to scroll, but if you opened when you are far down and return back, then it doesnâ€™t restore you at that position in the past.
- another related problem is that you cannot start reading the timeline from some point in time like start from a year ago

## New features

- I need tabs and screen split and other things like in tmux
- Convert thread into a book. Can choose layout for every tweet, combine them or do one tweet per page
