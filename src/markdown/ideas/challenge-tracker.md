This app offers a list of different challenges grouped by categories:

- one category handpicked for people who writes
- does software development
- or wants to improve their body and develop healthy habits.

It's more than just a list of tasks copied from the Internet, there is a social aspect to it. Ratings, comments, and ability to fork and improve.

All challenges are time based, and the app provides conviniet views for that: timer, calendar.
