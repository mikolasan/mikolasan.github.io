This app offers a list of different challenges grouped by categories:

- one category handpicked for people who write,
- do software development,
- or want to improve their body and develop healthy habits,
- etc.

It's more than just a list of tasks copied from the Internet, there is a social aspect to it: ratings, comments, and ability to fork and improve.

All challenges are time-based, and the app provides convenient views for that: timer and calendar.
