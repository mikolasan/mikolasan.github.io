Many services allow you to share files across devices and have it safely stored in backups. But, almost understandably, they have policies and not everything is okay to store.

So this app gives you options to add many layers of security: passwords, encryption keys, fingerprints, face pictures, personal questions, and more. And you can add as many layers as you want. Though the order is important. And when you decode information you have several options:
- the app guides you through steps in the right order
- the order is shuffled and only methods are provided
- or when all steps are up to the user to remember

Users would need to select correct methods from the all available in the app and do it in the right order.

So, because of many layers that you need to wrap and unwrap in order to encrypt or decrypt your data, the app will be called... no, not an onion. It's a cute knitting ball - clew.
