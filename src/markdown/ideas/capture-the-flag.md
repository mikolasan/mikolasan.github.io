Idea of the day. I want to design a challenge. You know, when it starts like a riddle, then you try your guesses and hopefully it will lead to the next clue. So I will add a link to my profile where it will start. I already planned what the first step is gonna be.

Will be super cool if I could branch out into several different approaches. So one path for programmers, another for pure mathematicians and so on.


**Attention:** spoilers ahead!!!

## First step

It will be a paragraph of text. There will be a hidden mask. When you apply this mask, it selects specific letters from the original text and tells you about the next step. I need to write such text that will slightly hint to the solution. Then in more limited amount of text I need to point to the following step. Maybe one will need to input a password to open next step or it can be a hint where to search for that.

First, I thought to use a picture for text. This will force to keep lines and vertical alignment. But if I use the `<pre>` tag or an SVG image - that might work too.

And to hide the mask in a browser reader mode? Possibly?
