On the main screen depicted a human. A user can pick any muscle and the app will show what set of workouts is recommended to develop the selected muscle.

Workouts are grouped by essential goals

- increase weight
- build muscles
- strength
- stamina

Every workout step is animated, when done it's marked as complete and switches to the next exercise tracking the whole progress.

The app can display different approaches to one exercise depending on the equipment available. Starting from doing it at home without anything to showing instructions for any gym equipment.

As a bonus users can upgrade their avatar in the app, change haircuts and clothes, and do other styling shit.
