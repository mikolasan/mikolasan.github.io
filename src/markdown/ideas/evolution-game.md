It can be an interesting card game, I mean real offline board game. Cruel and educational.

Iâ€™m going to go with tamagotchi idea for this game jam. Itâ€™s the only thing that fits good in my mind with the *evolution* theme.

The concept is developed a little bit further and the tamagotchi interface is going to control not just one pet, but a population. For the first prototype I will go with simple arithmetic, but I also have a thought to try Lotka-Volterra competition model. Thatâ€™s the only thing I remember from the course of mathematical models, but this name just stuck in my head for the end of my life ðŸ™‚
