Every post is a mini scientific article, and it will have meticulously formatted reference. So for any reference in following discussion it can be quickly linked. But it also means searched. And any comment and reply is basically a collaboration.

When it comes to scientific facts, people online often express themselves sharply and criticize any opinion or theory, which has a very detrimental effect on fresh, unorthodox views.
