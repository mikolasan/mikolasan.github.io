Speaking of RTS. I always wanted to make/play RTS where you control armies on the scale of thousands units. You gather armies, you select them and direct to the positions, the battle begins, and you can choose one unit and switch to hackâ€™n slash mode.

So you switch to FPS/TPS mode and personally participate in the fight when around you all of those thousands continue their battle. Your character may die, but you can move in to another soldier. In the end, only final result is important.
