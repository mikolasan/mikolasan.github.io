My favorite scenes in ghost movies are when something creepy happens on the background and out of sight for main characters.

And that’s a horror element of the game. There’s a main character, but we don’t control him directly. Evil ghosts constantly messing with him…

The main character needs to complete quests to advance in the game, but evil ghosts remove essential components required for the quest to be accomplished. Like going somewhere he needs a car, but car keys nowhere to be seen, and searching for them he got locked in the basement…

We play as a good ghost which fixes all the problems.

And here’s a twist. When we start to know more about the character, we learn more about the good ghost as well. Apparently that the good ghost was a better half of the poor guy.

In the second chapter we reincarnate and start fighting with bad ghosts together. In the end they both die, because there’s no horror story with a happy ending.
