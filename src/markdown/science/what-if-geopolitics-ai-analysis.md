title: '"What if" geopolitics AI analysis'
---

I want to create an AI system that would be able to answer theoretical questions about big geopolitical changes. For example

What if Russia will join European Union? Will it add only european part splitting Russia into parts and seperating asian part as an independent state?

The system that knows about underlying causes and connections between countries and alliences.
