Welcome to the first unpublished episode of my podcast: _About cheesy article from Science and a little step into quantum computing_.


## Cheesy article from Science

About ten years ago I’ve read about google building the first quantum computer. Maybe after that I’ve read about some stage whre they did 5 qubits that can produce basic arithmetics, but some people raised a question that quntum computers are more error prone than our usual computers.

What do you think about [this article title](https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all): **Ordinary computers can beat Google’s quantum computer after all**? 

Very specific wording. So what do they want you to think? Something like _How google have spent millions of dollars and years of research for nothing?_ Or _How some unknown researchers are smarter than google team?_

_Referenced article:_ **Solving the sampling problem of the Sycamore quantum supremacy circuits** [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03011.pdf)


## A little step into quantum computing

So here's the episode itself:
