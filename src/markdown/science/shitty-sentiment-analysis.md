title: Shitty sentiment analysis
---

This idea based on [shitty sentiment analysis](https://twitter.com/ImZackAdams/status/1526378770277576704)

Let me repeat it here:

> run last 500 tweets through shitty sentiment analysis and give a score between -1 (negative) and 1(positive)

I also want to generate a special pretty badge that you can post to Twitter that will display a special trait like ğŸ˜‡ or ğŸ˜ˆ
