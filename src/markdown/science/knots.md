_Math club notes_.

I've never heard about [knots (in mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)) and Khovanov homology invariants. Its calculation is, I quote, "prohibitively hard".

I mentioned 4th dimension as something unreachable, however for some objects this was the only way to solve their issues. Now [they prove](https://www.quantamagazine.org/special-surfaces-remain-distinct-in-four-dimensions-20220616/) it wrong ðŸ˜¨
