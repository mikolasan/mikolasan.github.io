title: Functional Analysis and Graph Theory
---


1. The theory of continuous graphs also known as [*graphons*][1] heavily relies on functional analysis of the Lebesgue space $L_1$ as one has to deal with certain limits of discrete objects with respect to the norm of $L_1$.
2. There is a characterisation of super-reflexive Banach space via impossibility of metric embedding of certain graphs (diamond graphs) into Banach spaces. See  papers by W.B. Johnson, A. Naor, M. Ostrovskii or G. Schechtman. For example: W. B. Johnson, G. Schechtman, [Diamond graphs and super-reflexivity][2], *J. Topol. Anal.*, 1 (2009), **2**, 177â€“189. 
3. There is a huge subfield of the theory operator algebras devoted to encoding graphs by certain C*-algebras (the so-called *graph algebras*). For example they generalise the Cuntz algebras which in a sense are building blocks of purely infinite algebras that are classifiable in certain sense. See these [introductory notes][3].
