sequence classification algorithms can be used to determine whether

- a DNA sequence is part of a gene-coding or a non-coding region,
- identify the introns or exons of a eukaryotic gene sequence,
- predict the secondary structure of a protein, or
- assign a protein sequence to a specific protein family
