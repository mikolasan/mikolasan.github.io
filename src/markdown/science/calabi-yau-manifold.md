I'm a mathematician. On my homepage I want to have something that would highlight this. Like an animation of some elusive manifold. A good friend of mine found mesmeraizing aimation of Calabi-Yau manifold. 

So to bring this animation to my website, I need to undestand the math behind it. Here is an [explanation how the manifold can be vizualized](https://analyticphysics.com/Higher%20Dimensions/Visualizing%20Calabi-Yau%20Manifolds.htm).

Another cool geometrical form is a [lemniscate](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lemniscate.html)
