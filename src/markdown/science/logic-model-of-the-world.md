_Math club notes_


I took one course about modal logic, that was fascinating. Kripke semantics have “for sure” and “maybe”. Sadly I only listened the theoretical part, but didn’t find any application 😔 Probably it is apllied by philosopers to make really wild arguments \[[Jorge](https://twitter.com/jrlgs/status/1575150349677215745)\]. But philosophers can make wild arguments without modal logic, don’t they? Like Wittgenstein who made a “logic” model of our world. I genuinely thought that I can put his work into code 😩
