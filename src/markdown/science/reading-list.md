Very interesting things that have very good write up, but I do not have time to read it all at the day when I see it and it's not usually aligned with current projects, but damn it's sooo good that I cannot lose it from my point of view. Link copied. Saved in git. Page saved on the drive. Backed up. ðŸ¤ž
