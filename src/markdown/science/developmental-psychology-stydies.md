_With Jorge Romero comments_

Lets try to frame the problem: there are motors connected to random pins. **How to figure out which one you need to actuate in order to move the whole system in the right direction?** I consider SNN and RNN, but looking for an alternative training method. That‚Äôs how I ended up with Piaget‚Äôs stages.

Instead is more like a "controlled fall" you dynamically "update" the tension of your muscles based on the "online" feedback from your environment, proprioception, the force of gravity, and thoughts. But the 'cause' of movement is all of those factors combined. So there is no "central" computer calculating movement based on some 'information' input.

## Proprioception

Here‚Äôs a long-standing puzzle from developmental psychology for you to crack today:

How infants imitate facial expression they cannot see themselves perform?



## Infantile amnesia

https://twitter.com/mikolasan/status/1578611661849579520

Why I don‚Äôt remember a thing before I was 4-5 years old? How is it explained by cognitive neuroscience?

Scientific term for this: infantile amnesia - the difficulty adults have in accessing memories from the first years of life

I‚Äôve read one article where they tried to disprove one hypothesis that infant‚Äôs brain is too simple to remember things. They brought 1 yo toddlers to an empty room with white walls, black table, and box with toys.

They demonstrate what in the box and test if kids remember it after 2 months. Despite creepy lab environment they were using original objects and actions. For example, touching a small box with a forehead in order to switch the light inside. Nevertheless the results were good

Experiments, show deferred imitation - so called one-shot learning in robotics (opposed to reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithm). But the provided research doesn‚Äôt answer what happens in the following years thus they propose another hypotheses

One is claimed obvious. At 18 months old the ‚Äúlanguage explosion‚Äù occurs, which divides all memories on nonverbal and verbal, but then authors reject this idea and call infantile amnesia to be a paradox

Hence Piagetian theory mentioned in the introduction holds a favor, but as I know it gives only psychological standpoint. In this theory a brain develops in stages and one stage depends on the previous one thus previous state (memories) can be ‚Äúerased‚Äù.

## Astral projections

https://twitter.com/mikolasan/status/1578276136554930176

Is it possible for neuromorphic computing explain phenomena of astral projections?

> There are two things. The phenomena of astral projections should first be framed as something that is subject to scientific study. And neuromorphic computation should be defined

_Neuromorphic computation_ referred to spiking neural networks "implemented in silicon" or other biologically plausible models.

> This definition doesn't really gives me much to work with ü§î First of all, seems to assume psychophysical dualism which is usually a big no-no üòÖ working around that, I think would require some really hardcore philosophy

Sounds like you want to criticize Descartes and Leibniz with their mind-body dualism. But why shouldn't we prefer monistic theories, functionalism in particular? Let's take Anokhin's theory of functional systems as a base and analyze if "motor imagery" fits into ü§ì

----

As a preamble, I can say that we may take two broad approaches. 

First, asking "what IS this stuff"? And second "what can we REASONABLY SAY about this stuff"? 

I think that the second question is more useful. And almost always ends up with monism being the best option for being able to explain as much as possible, while dualism makes certain phenomena basically untouchable by science. Which, as scientists is something we obviously don't want! 

So, my preference is epistemic in nature (if anything, I was an 'epistemologist', as that was the kind of research I did)

It may sound odd, but I don't have any grand philosophical argument about the nature of cognition. I just have a pragmatic argument for choosing the nice epistemic route. If that makes sense. It just allows us to do better science. That simple.

Having say THAT. There is a way I think of marrying functionalism (which can be dualistic) with monism. One of my friends was doing his PhD thesis on 'enactive functionalism' and had some stupidly interesting ideas (which I barely understood hahaha)

Another route would be something around structuralism I think. Find a way to describe some structure in the real world in abstract enough terms (cough... Category theory...cough) and make an argument that such structure is "cognitive" or rather cognition emerges there ü§Øü§Øü§Ø

So maybe, MAYBE, with such argument we could do away with the dualism-monism problem altogether. We could make an actually REASONABLE argument for cognition on whatever system we identify as such (including those that fit neuromorphic computation)

That's at least the sketch of what I thought hahahaha it's a philosophical can of worms. And it got me a LOT of angry comments at my presentations hahah

I wanted to do THAT with creativity. Find a sound structural definition of "creative system" 

Idk if that makes sense üòù

Going back, the only comment I would be able to make is about that "motor imagery" term. One of the things you loose with the kind of approach I sketch is both the need and the justification of representation or imagery. Either we don't care at all or they could not exist.

In enactivism for example, you do away with mental representations with which "the brain" does symbolic computation or whatever. Motion and sensing is an active 'online' process in which the individual, their brain, and their immediate environment are coupled together

So, you cannot reasonably talk about cognition without such system (ie, talking about what happens only on the brain). 

As you may imagine, that makes things incredibly murky hahah and it is extremely difficult to justify philosophically. I have absolutely no idea

I mean, one of the reasons we "settled" for a symbolic computation view of cognition on the 60s (the cognitive revolution) was because it made possible at the time to actually frame questions about the mind in terms amenable for doing science.

Just a note. This will get A LOT of people and cognitive science unreasonably angry on my experience...

But this approaches I am describing are older. Have some of their roots on cybernetics which is older than cognitivism. And seem closer to behaviourism than cognitive psychology.

Isn't that wild? ü§Ø

So yeah. I came back to cybernetics and Anhokin. 

Enactivism and "embodied cognition" in general broadly fit into the "dynamical systems" view of cognition. 

But we have to do away with almost 60 years of cognitive psychology to start seriously doing science with this!

So this "embodied cognition" ideas are pretty 'fresh' in a sense. Hahaha 

They are making their way into neuroscience tho. And I've seen more and more papers with these fundamental ideas baked in.
