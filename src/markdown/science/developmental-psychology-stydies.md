I consider SNN and RNN, but looking for an alternative training method. That’s how I ended up with Piaget’s stages.

Here’s a long-standing puzzle from developmental psychology for you to crack this Sunday:

How infants imitate facial expression they cannot see themselves perform?

> The answer from evolutionary psychology is pretty straightforward to grasp (and difficult to prove) 
> The "cognitive" explanation usually relies on assuming some computation 
> The approach from "embodied cognition" is, I think, more conductive to understanding...

Lets try to frame the problem:

there are motors connected to random pins. How to figure out which one you need to actuate in order to move the whole system in the right direction?

That goes along the lines of the "dynamical systems" approach to cognition. Dynamical systems, embodied cognition, cognitive robotics and so all take that approach.

Let me point you towards [Scott Kelso's "coordination dynamics"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cortical-coordination-dynamics-and-cognition-Bressler-Kelso/1a10508b6fdc44a2f1cc0a62659b0c87e46f8642) [PDF](http://www.ccs.fau.edu/~bressler/pdf/TICS01.pdf)

> the question is wrong on the first place. Animal movement is not achieved by applying torque on a set of motors. Instead is more like a "controlled fall" you dynamically "update" the tension of your muscles based on the "online" feedback from your environment, proprioception, the force of gravity, and thoughts. But the 'cause' of movement is all of those factors combined. So there is no "central" computer calculating movement based on some 'information' input.
