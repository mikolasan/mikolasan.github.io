Yesterday I thought that I should use something other than motors and started looking into magnets and electromagnets. I was already ready to buy solenoids, but the next morning while I was reading about wireless charging and excessive heat, I remembered that solenoids also become hot while they work. Exactly! You need to supply constant power to them in order to keep their shape, while as the motors stay in their position. Right? Oh no, just motors already have fears inside 
And then I discovered new development that people try to make popular - silicone inflatable robots, also known as soft robots. They try to be more flexible, light and modern. But they heavily depend on air, pump, compressor, valves, hermetic connections. And usually this approach is very slow unless you use pneumatic system. It’s so early in development. I don’t see one autonomous prototype. I don’t see a complete leg or arm, even not saying about full body
