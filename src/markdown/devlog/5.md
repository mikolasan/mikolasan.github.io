> Something interesting always starts with something very stupid


The big problem with open source world is that some cool projects stay in the shadow. No one notices it if no one mentions it, and if the maintainer is not a public person. Also when it's missing live ecosystem.


release plan

- Order components: servo, DC, brushless motors, sensors, battery, logic board
- Manufacture PCB for motor/power/sensor board
- Design 3D body
- Face animations on LCD

Letâ€™s sum up what it can do.



## Features 

- Cute
- Talk jokes 
- Finds users face (camera, IR sensor)
- Detects emotions 
- Keep up the conversation 
- Recognizes speech 
- Voice generation 
- movements (maybe just waving or driving on a flat surface )



More realistic plan. Create a hexapod design, give 3d parts for free, publish settings for slicer programs, recommend the best colors for filament, affiliated links to purchase filament.
