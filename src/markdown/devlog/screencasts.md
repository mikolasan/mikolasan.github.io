How to get picture from remote OBS as Video Source? (stream from one obs to another)
May be not possible in these words, but very close solution:

You will need VLC 64 bit https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-studio-how-to-get-vlc-video-source.72661/
Correct setup with screenshots (woaw, screenshots are helpful) https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-studio-send-an-udp-stream-to-a-second-pc-using-obs.55379/page-3
Real question without answer

Next approach would be RTMP?
