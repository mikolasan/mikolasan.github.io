What if the oracle from The Matrix was right? She said, the choice is already made, you only need to accept it. This is rather philosophical conclusion, but sometimes it really feels that way and here’s why. I will tell you my current working hypothesis, how decision-making is working in sort of simple spiking neural network. So we have receptors, actuators, generator network, discriminator network, memory - and that’s all repeat for different senses and they are interconnected. In some primitive examples it has to boil down to vision and motor reflexes, because decisions like in what college I should go is based on many memories, emotions and language related things.In simplified form (if we only track inputs, environment state, action, environment response) it will highly likely be one to one reinforcement learning. Yes, new actions and positive feedback will release dopamine and improve connections for decisions which led to the result. So what  reinforcement learning is lacking ? As I said it’s a simplified form because First, we must combine several sensory inputs (vision, priproitetion) and indirect factors () fatigue, hunger ) which would be added with big enthusiasm by embodiment researchers.Second, it’s lacking memory as a concept. It only has the resulting probabilities, but it can not go through the memories again. It cannot go further and explore associations.
