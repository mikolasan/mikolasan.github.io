What if the oracle from The Matrix was right? She said

> Because you didn't come here to make the choice, you've already made it.
> You're here to try to understand *why* you made it.
> I thought you'd have figured that out by now.

The choice is already made, you only need to accept it. This is rather a philosophical conclusion, but sometimes it really feels that way, and here’s why.

I will tell you my current working hypothesis, and how decision-making is working in some sort of simple spiking neural network.

Let's say we track only inputs, environment state, action, and environment response. It will highly likely be one-to-one reinforcement learning.
New actions and positive feedback will release dopamine and improve connections for decisions which leads to the result.

So what reinforcement learning is lacking? As I said it’s a simplified form. 
Decisions like "In what college should I go?" are based on many memories, emotions, and language-related things.

First, we must combine several sensory inputs (vision, proprioception) and indirect factors (fatigue, hunger), causing a great enthusiasm among embodiment researchers.

Second, it’s lacking memory as a concept. It only has the resulting probabilities, but it can not go through the memories again. It cannot explore associations.

So, we have receptors, actuators, a generator network, a discriminator network, and memory.
Repeat all that for every different sense, and then connect them.
