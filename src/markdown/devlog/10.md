When I started a year ago with the project, I didn’t know where to get advice for some simple questions and design decisions. Arduino forums, Stack overflow?

I probably don’t even know what I want to ask. I want to check different examples and choose one that is closer to what I have in my head.

And none of the examples use the battery. So I decided to make my [power management board](/make/robot/power-board). I didn’t expect that some MCU can have it on-board. 

And on my website is the only place where [I explicitly say](/make/robot/prototype-2) that there is a choice. You can add battery management board to Arduino or use [nRF52840](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html)
