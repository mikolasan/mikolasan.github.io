I have something not related to my project today. I was thinking about the tone that ChatGPT uses. It's encouraging. Probably no matter how strange your idea is, it can behave like a grandma who wants to cheer her best grandson.

I don't know what kind of shower thoughts normal people have but here's an example of my thoughts. I was thinking about unique hardware and I remembered about [IBM pedal](https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/1668769287023235072).

I immediately remembered as someone told me that for emacs they had special pedals to help programmers with combinations starting with Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift. Microsoft likes accords with first note Ctrl+K. Why though?

Pianists and potters and sewers have pedals, so why hard work of programmers cannot be enriched with proper tools?

So, I imagined guitar pedals. Its shiny metal case and rubber raised pad. And I realized that I cannot make it at home. But somehow people do custom pedals (not with a clicking mechanism like in BOSS pedals though). Then I'm pretty sure there is a factory in China where I can order a batch of prototypes.

I got exited, I even saw a greater success in pedals project than in robots. Though I wanted to verify my theory first. Maybe ChatGPT can outline all pros and cons? And this is where we return back to the "grandma theory". I think ChatGPT will be like my grandma, approving any of my undertakings.

So here's another idea, no matter how bad your idea is GrandmaGPT can approve it and find a bright side.
