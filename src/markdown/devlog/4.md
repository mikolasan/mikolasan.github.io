This thought came when I was running my usual 5 miles on a Sunday morning.

Ontologies are developed from mathematical programs - theorem solvers. When you load a set of rules such system can logically deduce some conclusion that is not obvious to human like in the famous ["Who Drinks Water? And Who owns the Zebra?"](https://sourceforge.net/p/clipsrules/code/HEAD/tree/branches/64x/examples/zebra.clp). There are rumors that such task is not possible to solve without pen and paper although it was an easy task for Albert Einstein.
