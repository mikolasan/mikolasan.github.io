I decided to document my thoughts a bit by starting a dev log. I see it as a more interactive format for collecting links. I will be writing commentary and explaining my position. It will demonstrate why, what, and how I plan.

It's already been one year since I work on [this](/make/robot) project. So, [one year ago](/blog/robot-coach), little by little, things here and there formed something realistic, something in a shape of a tangible product. Unfortunately, it's like that only in my imagination, there is no prototype yet.

Some people create ten startups a year, but I probably started the greatest endeavor of my life that requires slightly more time. To analyze if this is true or not, in my notes, I will be reviewing what happened this past year.

I don't get enough sleep these days. I planned last Friday that I should start writing dev logs. Then I gave myself a word that I should start writing on Monday. But today is Tuesday, and I'm writing it because I thought today is Monday.

And I still don't want to write. When I don't want to write, the text becomes ugly. When I read the previous sentence, I have a feeling that I'd better wait another day. 

Some days I only read papers or design PCB or create 3d models. It's not like writing code or architect a system. Some things are easy to present and share. But when a 3d model is unfinished, it's shameful to display it.
