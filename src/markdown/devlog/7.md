Saturday mornings are always bring some deep thoughts. This week I'm thinking about memory, how to store and retreive patterns with spiking network nature.

If you are a regular data scientist then you must be familiar with the MNIST dataset. So let's take a network trained with MNIST, and it can recognize digits quite well. In this limited model, numbers is the regular world. It sees them everywhere. It’s very familiar with them, recognition is not a problem - it’s a mundane task.

But what if we present to this model a new symbol, a star. This is super nova for the model. What will it try to do? It will quickly understand that it cannot match the star to anything known, and it will start process of remembering.

To make this into memory special neurotransmitters must be released, this will confirm that the stimuli looks for a new way. You can think that our brain is not very predictive and it will put the star in a random empty space, and release dopamine, and everyone will be happy. Actually no.

It’s predictable. But it heavily varies from person to person based on their previous experience. The star will find its way in a place where similar patterns are stored. This will ignite some old memories, that we call associations, and it will activate similar neurotransmitters.

If that area in memory is sad, then the star will be associated with a sad experience. Hopefully not everything is sad in our life. When we see something unexpected, it will be met with extreme delight. 
That’s why some art is boring because it associated with mundane stuff, but we very appreciate even some strange abstract splashes because they represent new texture not related to our previous experience and it excites us.
