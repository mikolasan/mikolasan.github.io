Saturday mornings are always bring some deep thoughts. This week I'm thinking about memory, how to store and retrieve patterns with spiking network nature.

If you are a regular data scientist then you must be familiar with the MNIST dataset. So let's take a network trained with MNIST. It can recognize digits quite well. In this limited model, numbers is the whole world for the model. It sees them everywhere. It’s very familiar with them, recognition is not a problem - it’s a mundane task.

But what if we present to this model a new symbol, a star. This is super nova for the model. What will it try to do? Most likely it will falsely detect it as 4. But what it _should_ do? It should quickly understand that it cannot match the star to anything known and start a process of remembering.

To make this into memory special neurotransmitters must be released, this will confirm that the stimuli looks for a new way. Will it put the star in a random empty space in memory? When it's done, it will release dopamine, and everyone will be happy?

For every new pattern search for an empty space. It will be a random place for every individual. And you probably think that this is what makes all individuals different, because the learning process is unpredictable.

Actually, no, it’s predictable. Because patterns do not take any random empty space. The star will find its way in a place where similar patterns are stored. This will ignite some old memories, that we call associations, and it will activate similar neurotransmitters.

Memories heavily vary from person to person based on their previous experience. If that area in memory is sad, then the star will be associated with a sad experience. But also it will share some cells with another patterns, like number 4 or 7, some spiky ones. This is the key to how a system with learning process that takes random spots can observe stable and predictable inference results.

Hopefully not everything is sad in our life. When we see something unexpected, it will be met with extreme delight.
That’s why some art is boring because it associated with mundane stuff, but we very appreciate even some strange abstract splashes because they represent new texture not related to our previous experience and that excites us.
