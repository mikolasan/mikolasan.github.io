I build [Android ROMs](/linux/build-lineage-15) and I feel miserable. No, I have a good rig at my disposal with 12 cores, it can build the whole thing from scratch under 30 minutes.

I feel like a mole - blind, only narrow understanding of available functionality. Many tools are in separate repositories, documentation is scattered. Build system is a mix of nested Makefiles, Python scriipts and Go programs.

I needed to put a recompiled library in place where the build system will see it. I tried a special approach designed for precompiled libraries. But it doesn’t work.

Is it possible to debug Make? I don't want to do it with print statements like some junior developer. I’m talking about a real approach with breakpoints, and step-by-step execution, and list of all defined variables and their values.

I found [this](https://elinux.org/Debugging_Makefiles)
