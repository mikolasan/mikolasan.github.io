Design a robot in three easy steps:

- [3d print](/make/3d-printer-dilemma)
- [buy components](/make/where-to-buy-electronic-components-in-us)
- assemble

mu-ha-ha ðŸ¤£ In reality you need to overcome a little bit more steps.


## The look and shape

In this light I put on the first place the functional capabilities of the thing you want to build.

- Does it move? Mechanical tracks, or wheels, or legs? But keep in mind that even [one vibration motor](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/13/8/1184) can move in complex trajectories.
- Inside or outside? It needs a battery.
- How complex its movements in the space? Just moving or also make interactions with the world: drawing, grab things? Extra servomotors. Inspiration: [rolling spider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z-aT8Wp2YQ)
- What obstacles it needs to conquer? Lidar or ultrasonic sensors. 
- Flat floor and walls and doors? Climb stairs? Think about adding more legs for stability like [hexapod](/make/robot/hexapod) and gyro sensor.
- Jump on the desk and from it? [Fly like a butterfly](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.add3788)? Probably you are building a drone now.
- Should it collect information? Add sensors 

It worth looking through [popular designs](/make/robot/encyclopedia). I started a research about [appearance design](/make/robot/appearance-design) in order to understand how to make it look cute or evil.


## Hardware components

- Battery charger and step up voltage regulator in one [power board](/make/robot/power-board)
- [Motors](/make/robot/motors) with [encoders](https://www.pololu.com/product-info-merged/4761)
- [Motor driver board](/make/robot/motor-controller-board) in case we decide to add motors for any purpose
- [Sensor board](/make/robot/sensor-board) (accelerometer, ultrasonic sensor)
- Gyro
- Tilt sensor
- Time of flight sensor

To design a printed circuit board you will need to learn at least some basics of CAD software like Eagle, Fusion 360, KiCAD. Here is mine notes: [PCB design 101](/make/pcb-design-101)

Modular design dictates to find a way to put the boards together. For example with [castellated mount holes](/blog/castellated-vias).


## Prototype

Before really doing [version 1](/make/robot/prototype-1) I plan to look closer into targeting it as a board for making [Arduino-based drone](/make/robot/arduino-drone) and flexible for [constructor kit](/make/robot/constructor) purposes.

Many other things get postponed to [version 2](/make/robot/prototype-2).

Planning next: [eco-friendly](/make/robot/eco-friendly) robot
