## Electromagnets

## Soft robotics

Interesting topic called [Soft robotics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adma.202170145). Shape changing, regenerating 

Instead of a spring you can use a [fishing line](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1246906) (Science, 21 Feb 2014, Vol 343, Issue 6173, pp. 868-872). 
Just twist the fishing line and will swirl into thin spring. If you apply heat it will contract. If you wind up a copper whire around the fishing line first then it can dissipate heat when electricity is applied to the wire.
