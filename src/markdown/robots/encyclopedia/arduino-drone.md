- Based on [indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elf-the-hd-video-streaming-nano-drone#/), ElecFreaks seems like a scam company, they promised to develop open sourced mini drones

but didn't deliver them, their app is removed from app stores and no code, no PCBs. The brain board looks cool on promo materials, but today only thing I find is a [3D case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:501904)

- Interesting that in some builds you need power distribution board and electronic speed controller (ESC), but [some](https://www.diyprojectslab.com/make-esp8266-drone-wallclimb-drone/) just power directly from the battery and connect to the logic board through MOSFETs.
