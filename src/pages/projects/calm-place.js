        I have listened about healing forests on a <a href="https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/04/17-14-mu-podcast/">Mysterious Universe podcast</a>.
        They have discussed a book "The Nature Fix: Why Nature Makes us Happier, Healthier, and More Creative" by Florence Williams.

        So even if you are in the wilderness away from your neighbours listening music in 7am, dogs barking all day, 
        from all machinery as air conditioner, fans; construction noise, you can still encounter airplanes flying over you.
        That is why I create a solution, to find a proper place in the nature where you will be really alone.
