    <p>
    Since early days in school I was reading video game magazines, 
    I liked playing pithy RPG and rapid action games, 
    I discussed them with friends and we dreamed about making our own. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Here I am, I have been doing game development for 10 years in the gambling industry.
    It brings mathematical challenges and the warmth of Las Vegas.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am a full-time developer, once a year traveler and a snob ever since I registered on Instagram.
    I have a postgraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer <a href="/science">Science</a>. With its help, I do what I do for a living.
    But besides that, I passionate about <a href="/gamedev">game development</a> and irrational exploitation of computers.

    <h2>I Like</h2>
    <p>
      I like my mountain bike. It allows me to consume(appreciate) nature with the speed  that enough to see landscape from different angles and as a still image when you liked some composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like board games. First of all they represent an art piece. Then they have a story, setting and specific rules in their world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like hardware, electronic components, limited resources and capabilities.
    </p>
