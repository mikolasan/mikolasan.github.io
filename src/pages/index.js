        This way you do backups. Windows and programs can be reinstalled,
        but your filesâ€”they made out of sweat, pain and love,

        Plus a screen with emotion expressions and wheels to poke around on the table and find a charger station when needed.
        </p>
        <p>

        It should pose an angry reaction when you are out of track in your plan.
