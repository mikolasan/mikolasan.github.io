        <p className="home_subtitle">and pattern formal model as a fix-point of anticipations</p>
        <p>
        Formalization of the notions of perception and pattern are presented. 
        Perception of some pattern considers as continues process of anticipations (predictions) 
        by the pattern of entering stimulus and control of coincidence of anticipated and real stimulus. 
        As formalization of this process the fix-point of anticipations is proposed. 
        Computer simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of this model are carried out.

        <h1>My Last Summer</h1>
        <p>
        Daytime in Novosibirsk is extremely long. 
        The Sun comes out early as 4am, 
        but as night person I wake up between 9 and 11am. 
        If I go out of bed at 9, 
        then I drink coffee, check social, post something and at 10 Iâ€™m ready to work. 
        What it means for me is that I change the pants and go to another room. 
        As an entrepreneur that has a contract with a foreign company all my work happens at home. 
        So first thing in the morning I check Slack, 
        email and the issue tracker We used the issue tracker before, 
        but without a dedicated manager 
        it is easy between programmers to communicate in Slack
         and track current tasks in your personal notes. 
        I use Trello for that. 
        Some notes I delete when they are done, 
        but other cards become a storage of important information. 
        In another words Trello is my personal knowledge base.
