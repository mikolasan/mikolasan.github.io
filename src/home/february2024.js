    <p>For some reason I just like Reed-Solomon codes by their name, 
    it’s the first thing that pops in my mind,

    When we witness something unexpected, it will be seen with extreme delight. 
    That’s why some art could be boring because it is associated with mundane stuff, 
    but we very much appreciate even some strange abstract splashes because...
