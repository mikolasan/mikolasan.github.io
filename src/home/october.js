    <p>make all neurons physical objects like balls</p>
    <p>Find a working example with a small neural network and make all neurons physical, 
    and train it much faster because all neuron is independent. 
    Each neuron is a FPGA that just immediately reacts on incoming signal, adjusts its weights and carry on.</p>`,

    so maybe I should take a look at the sources and strip it.</p>`,

    It exlaims about transformer model abilities</p>
    <p><i>NN learns <b>how to learn</b> linear regression, decision trees, 2-layer ReLU nets ðŸ˜²
    furthermore: outperforms XGBoost, does Lasso in one-pass, seems not to rely on nearest-neighbor.</i></p>
    <p>I looked carefully through the article. 
    The example looks simple, and I want to play with linear approximation and find its limitation. 
    Good thing they published model and training scripts.</p>
    <p>At work we recently deployed POS (point of sale) software written in Python. 
    Web server, DB connector, abstract classes, function decorators. 
    It is great. 
    Python is great. 
    But when I read implementation of a ML algorithm from this paper Iâ€™m starting to hate Python.</p>`,
