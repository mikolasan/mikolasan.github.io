    <p>It all started with a tweet. 
    Someone asked for a robot that can track your time on the computer.
    A cute robot-companion that cares about you.
    Or maybe a strict robot-coach that meticulously plans your time.</p>

    <p>Basic install of elasticsearch with only system metrics takes 2.3GB of memory.</p>
    <p>I'm not saying that it created a nice dashboard, it could be better. But I like that the system is very modular, 
    so maybe I should take a look at the sources and strip it.</p>`,

    excerpt: `<p>One morning I see in my timeline one tweet. 
    It exlaims about transformer model abilities</p>
    <p><i>NN learns <b>how to learn</b> linear regression, decision trees, 2-layer ReLU nets ðŸ˜²
    furthermore: outperforms XGBoost, does Lasso in one-pass, seems not to rely on nearest-neighbor.</i></p>
    <p>I looked carefully through the article. 
    The example looks simple, and I want to play with linear approximation and find its limitation. 
    Good thing they published model and training scripts.</p>
    <p>At work we recently deployed POS (point of sale) software written in Python. 
    Web server, DB connector, abstract classes, function decorators. 
    It is great. 
    Python is great. 
    But when I read implementation of a ML algorithm from this paper Iâ€™m starting to hate Python.</p>`,
