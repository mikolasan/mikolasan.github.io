    From one side, we use discrete time points, 
    moments when a neuron has transmitted the action potential to following dendrites, 
    but we need to track the dynamics of how values change when new inputs reappear on some neurons while the previous chain reaction is still propagating. 
    Feedback signals and loops are essential features of this model, and that is what makes it an open problem here.</p>`,

    The idea is that we can take that generator and prepend a fully connected network that maps Gaussian noise
