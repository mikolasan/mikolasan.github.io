    excerpt: `<p>First, we need to clarify how to work with the signal propagation in time. 
    From one side, we use discrete time points, 
    moments when a neuron has transmitted the action potential to following dendrites, 
    but we need to track the dynamics of how values change when new inputs reappear on some neurons while the previous chain reaction is still propagating. 
    Feedback signals and loops are essential features of this model, and that is what makes it an open problem here.</p>`,

    What is stored in memory? Short little facts or chains of events? 
    The main question is what data we need to train such memory and how this stored information is used?</p>`,
