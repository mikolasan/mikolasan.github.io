    <p>Find a working example with a small neural network and make all neurons physical, 
    and train it much faster because all neuron is independent. 
    Each neuron is a FPGA that just immediately reacts on incoming signal, adjusts its weights and carry on.</p>`,

    <p>Basic install of elasticsearch with only system metrics takes 2.3GB of memory.</p>

    so maybe I should take a look at the sources and strip it.</p>`,

    <p>After a few successful releases, our boss wanted to encourage our team. He defined a fund that we could spend on the office "improvements".</p>
    <p>His idea was to buy the Xboxâ€”that was the exact amount in the fund. $150 for Xbox 360, sounds right? But we could use the same amount for other things if we wanted to.</p>
    <p>I don't remember why, but I searched for alternatives and found a 3D printer. The 3D printer comes disassembled, and we would spend weekends assembling it. Sounds fun, right?</p>
