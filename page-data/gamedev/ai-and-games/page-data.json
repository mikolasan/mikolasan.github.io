I‚Äôm thinking to learn about procedural generation and also use some AI method to generate completely new assets. But it‚Äôs a huge task so I rather choose another hobby. Just kidding.</p>\n<p><em>Andraz Vene</em>: Procedural assets sound like a big one indeed! Have you considering focusing on a genre, where assets are more available, or they are more \"programmer art\" that can look well? I.e. so not some platformer with characters, but i.e. regular shapes or something?</p>\n<p>I refer here to my roguelike project. Top down view. My initial plan was 48x48 pixels for a tile. The game starts in a regular bar, then advance to sci-fi location in a space craft where I need many different alien characters. I was sure that I can find pixel art characters and animations, but I did find only very good reference. So I tried to create my own stuff. It might be easy for me to pretend that I'm a good artist if I would start with 16x16 size ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And yes, my next struggle was with a 3D logic game where I wanted a nice model of a chip (like one in checkers). I wanted to upgrade simple cylinders and make them look like crystals. Well, I failed with that idea too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Goldilocks zone - something about task that can be tackled but not completely solved</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"3d-generated-rooms\" style=\"position:relative;\">3D generated rooms<a href=\"#3d-generated-rooms\" aria-label=\"3d generated rooms permalink\" class=\"with-anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\">\n                <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3\n                3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3\n                  9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64\n                  1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\">\n                </path>\n                </svg></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Replica Dataset</a> is a dataset of high quality reconstructions of a variety of indoor spaces.
