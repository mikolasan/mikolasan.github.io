I want a motor to rotate at 3.5 RPM.\nCurrent says that should be 3.2 volts.\nI can set my a-d to keep my d-a at 3.2 volts.\nHowever that does not guarantee that the motor will travel at 3.5 RPM.\nThe only way to guarantee that (?) is to put in an encoder and set the control to 3.5 RPM.\nHowever if at 3.2 volts, I do not achieve 3.5 RPM, there is additional load and drag.\nIf the desired RPM is not even close, then we have a problem and should abort.\nIt's a lot of extra work, but it achieves a significantly <em>superior product</em>.</p>\n<p>I need to know more about what he is using it for.\nIf for positioning, it is different than if for speed control.</p>\n<p>Also, have him look up snubber circuits. These take the backflow and shunt it into a cap to reduce feedback voltage. It helps us not blow up on an instant reverse.</p>\n<p>On positioning, if exact is needed and it's fair mass,\nthen you need a ramp up, down, and hold function.\nThis needs encoder feedback.\nThere is a 1 chip control solution but is fairly expensive.</p>\n<p>Drive power should always tailor to the load and thus discrete components.</p>\n<p>Let me know what he wants to do with it and I'll give more.\nMicrochip and stm are great control chips for high power apps.\nAlso let me know if the control needs to be synced with other controls.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Mosfets are controlled by voltage (opposite to normal transistors that are controlled by current)</p>\n<p>More links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/power_mosfets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/power_mosfets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_7.html</a></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"One more thing I advise him to do, is to put in an a-d to verify current control.\nMosfets have a turn on current, and then a rise current…","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"date":"November 11, 2022","published":"December 20, 2022","lastModified":"December 20, 2022","title":"The letter from Tony's Engineer","subtitle":null,"section":"robot","draft":null,"developing":null,"buttonText":null,"buttonLink":null,"secondButtonText":null,"secondButtonLink":null,"featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"showLikes":true,"absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mikolasan.github.io/mikolasan.github.io/src/markdown/robots/letter-from-the-engineer.md","url":"/robots/letter-from-the-engineer","next":{"excerpt":"3D printing Tracks PLA Prusament Black Galaxy    Wheels 2x Yellow PLA Prusament, 2x PETG     Body Yellow PETG     One evening example What's…","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mikolasan.github.io/mikolasan.github.io/src/markdown/robots/prototype-1.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Prototype 1","date":"2022-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","topic":null,"article":null},"id":"93ab3a76-619e-5a31-9bd6-f19e1d9a0171"},"previous":{"excerpt":"Observation: everyone creates their version [of motor controller/driver board] Starfish by Stargirl Acorn by Taylor Alexander or relies on…","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mikolasan.github.io/mikolasan.github.io/src/markdown/robots/motor-controller-board.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Motor controller board","date":"2022-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","topic":null,"article":null},"id":"1b083bf4-b011-55c5-95a0-e15062971d7c"},"recentArticles":[{"excerpt":"Introduction Power source Design power board Solar powered Movements and muscles Sensors Motors Muscles Compensate motor jitter Carcass…","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mikolasan.github.io/mikolasan.github.io/src/markdown/robots/NAV.md","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"topic":null,"article":null},"id":"90a9d1b7-2196-5980-bc97-cd15eb12634e"},{"excerpt":"Can you explain what do you find in ROS that is missing in regular Linux?
