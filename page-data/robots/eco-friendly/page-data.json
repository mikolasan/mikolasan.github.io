This can  minimize the use of fertilizers and pesticides.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The robot's primary function will be to assist users in managing their daily tasks, reminders, and communication needs, but with an added focus on eco-consciousness. The robot will have various attachment points for users to add and customize different modules such as sensors, actuators, mini-gardens, air quality monitors, or even smart home control modules = modular</p>\n<p>The robot can provide gardening tips and reminders for planting, watering, and maintaining a sustainable garden. It can suggest recipes from local plant-based ingredients.</p>\n<p>It will offer real-time feedback and motivation to help users achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>Good examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customizable (programmability)</strong>, people will spend time creating their modules, extensions, versions. Like Arduino or Raspberry Pi which is just a platform or dog-like robots</li>\n<li>New functionality that is also hackable. Like Flipper Zero has a radio transmitter</li>\n<li>Cute face with emotions and reactions. Like Tamagotchi, M5 Stack. <em>It can show notifications with special mimics.</em></li>\n<li>Solves one task well. Tracks your tasks, shows reminders, records and transcribes conversations,</li>\n<li>Resembles current trends. Like dog robots.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bad examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>requires another boards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>big size, bulky design</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>fixed single configuration</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How can I build my own eco-friendly robot?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What are the challenges of creating a robot that will grow and propagate plants indoors in regular homes and apartments in a space not bigger than a desk?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What are some challenges of selling eco-friendly robots?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What are some future trends in eco-friendly robotics?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It might be the case that consumers were less likely to buy a \"green\" product if they perceived it as less effective or less attractive than a conventional product.</p>","excerpt":"What eco-friendly robot differs from others?
