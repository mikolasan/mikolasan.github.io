You need to supply constant power to solenoids in order to keep their position, while the motors stay in their position. Right? Only motors that already have gears inside—gear motors.</p>\n<p>Then I discovered a new development that people try to make popular—silicone inflatable robots, also known as <strong>soft robots</strong>. They try to be more flexible, light, and modern. But they heavily depend on air, pump, compressor, valves, and hermetic connections. Usually, this approach is very slow unless you use a pneumatic system. It’s so early in development. I don’t see one autonomous prototype. I don’t see a complete leg or arm, even not saying about full body.</p>","excerpt":"Yesterday I thought that I should use something other than motors and started looking into magnets and electromagnets.\nI was already ready…","tableOfContents":"","fields":{"socialcard":"gatsby-plugin-social-card/065ab070-8b30-51b9-a5d8-a0e7b6b59e3f.jpg"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 16, 2023","published":"July 16, 2023","lastModified":"July 16, 2023","title":"Alternatives to motors","subtitle":"and soft robots in Devlog #13","section":"robots","draft":null,"developing":null,"buttonText":null,"buttonLink":null,"secondButtonText":null,"secondButtonLink":null,"featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"showLikes":true,"absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mikolasan.github.io/mikolasan.github.io/src/markdown/devlog/13.md","url":"/devlog/13","next":{"excerpt":"I want to thoughtfully reverse engineer how Midjourney works so good comparing to DALL-E.
