This is rather a philosophical conclusion, but sometimes it really feels that way, and here’s why.</p>\n<p>I will tell you my current working hypothesis, and how decision-making is working in some sort of simple spiking neural network.</p>\n<p>Let's say we track only inputs, environment state, action, and environment response. It will highly likely be one-to-one reinforcement learning.\nNew actions and positive feedback will release dopamine and improve connections for decisions which leads to the result.</p>\n<p>So what reinforcement learning is lacking? As I said it’s a simplified form.\nDecisions like \"In what college should I go?\" are based on many memories, emotions, and language-related things.</p>\n<p>First, we must combine several sensory inputs (vision, proprioception) and indirect factors (fatigue, hunger), causing a great enthusiasm among embodiment researchers.</p>\n<p>Second, it’s lacking memory as a concept. It only has the resulting probabilities, but it can not go through the memories again. It cannot explore associations.</p>\n<p>So, we have receptors, actuators, a generator network, a discriminator network, and memory.\nRepeat all that for every different sense, and then connect them.</p>","excerpt":"What if the oracle from The Matrix was right?
