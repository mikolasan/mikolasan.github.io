Have you noticed, Microsoft likes accords with first note Ctrl+K to this very day. Why though?</p>\n<p>Pianists and potters and sewers have pedals, so why hard work of programmers cannot be brighten up with proper tools?</p>\n<p>So, I imagined guitar pedals. Its shiny metal case and rubber raised pad. And I realized that I cannot make it at home. But somehow people do custom pedals (not with a clicking mechanism like in BOSS pedals though). Then I'm pretty sure there is a factory in China where I can order <a href=\"https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/1590B-Hammond-Box-Aluminum-Box-Aluminum_60336478083.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a batch of prototypes</a>.</p>\n<p>I got exited, I even saw possible success in pedals project greater than in robots. Though I wanted to verify my theory first. Maybe ChatGPT can outline all pros and cons? And this is where we return back to the <em>grandma theory</em>. I think ChatGPT will be like my grandma, approving any of my undertakings.</p>\n<p>So here's idea for the online service: <strong>GrandmaGPT</strong>. No matter how bad your idea is, GrandmaGPT can approve it and find a bright side.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>But let's talk about robots. Also on Alibaba I found a robot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../make/robot/six-feet-chinese-war-robot.webp\" alt=\"Little cute robot with six legs and two little arms, \"></p>\n<p>Six feet Chinese war robot (<a href=\"https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Six-Feet-B-O-Dancing-Robot_1600060530606.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">source</a>). It's a little robot with six legs (six feet is not about its size) and two little arms, found on Chinese marketplace. It has <strong>WAR</strong> label on it, but it might be abbreviation for some of its cute functionalities.</p>\n<p>Its leg position is interesting. Legs go around the body and not like you'd normally see in hexapods - two straight lines of three legs on each side. This one probably is not moving and only \"dancing\", but would it be possible to move in such configuration?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/devlog/4\">Next</a></p>","excerpt":"I have something not related to my project today.
