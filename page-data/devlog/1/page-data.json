I see it as a more interactive format for collecting links. It will demonstrate why, what, and how I plan.</p>\n<p>Sometimes these will be short notes where I'll share my commentary on specific topics. Sometimes I will record my new thoughts and show where they usually go.</p>\n<p>It's already been one year since I work on <a href=\"/make/robot\">this</a> project. So, <a href=\"/blog/robot-coach\">one year ago</a>, little by little, things here and there formed something realistic, something in a shape of a tangible product. Unfortunately, it's like that only in my imagination, there is no prototype yet.</p>\n<p>Some people create ten startups a year, but I probably started the greatest endeavor of my life that requires slightly more time. To analyze if this is true or not, in these notes, I will be reviewing what happened this past year.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I don't get enough sleep these days. I planned last Friday that I should start writing dev logs. Then I gave myself a word that I should start writing on Monday. But today is Tuesday, and I'm writing it because I thought today is Monday.</p>\n<p>And I still don't want to write. When I don't want to write, the text becomes ugly. When I read the previous sentence, I have a feeling that I'd better wait another day. <strong>Update:</strong> No matter what, I return to my notes later (as with this edit), read them again and fix them if they do not sound clear.</p>\n<p>Some days I only read papers or design PCB or create 3d models. It's not like writing code or architect a system. Some things are easy to present and share. But when a 3d model is unfinished, I'm ashamed to show it.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
