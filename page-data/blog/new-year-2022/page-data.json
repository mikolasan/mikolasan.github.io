For tax purposes I registered my own company and now they are my first client.\nI cannot say that I learned CSS, I was just trying my best to make my website that looks okay on mobile as well as on desktop. I used !important few times this year. I started my website as an online resume, but then I found myself motivated to write down notes about my work and game development. Even though my website exists in the abyss, but I will continue writing because the site works well as a personal knowledge base. Also my content is unsystematic and navigation is bad, but I will address this in this year.</p>\n<p>In December I wanted to have at least one thing finished, but instead I went for a long vacation. Hopefully it will be the beginning of a good story, but I can only tell you about it later. Anyway I have big ambitions for this year.\nSo no matter what you are planning to do in 2022 like make a game or build a startup, let’s make it happen!</p>","excerpt":"Happy New Year everyone!
