In principle, simple and convenient for mathematicians. And there is a euphemism among students \"to solve tasks in Fortran\" (it can by any other verb but the thing is that Fortran is rarely assigned and few people code in it, so the word Fortran is the key word here) and this phrase means to have sex.</p>\n<p>So, there was a girl in our group, Lily, with whom we seemed to be developing something romantically.</p>\n<p>I'm usually bad at remembering names. But during my 3 years at the university, I certainly learned the names of all my classmates. There were about 12 of them on average. I also had a crush on one girl from my group. I helped her with writing programs for computer classes, she helped me with philosophical nonsense.</p>\n<p>One day, we were all sitting in class, I turned to another girl from our group and called her out loudly enough, using a different name. But I said it with such confidence that she understood that I meant her, but she said: after all these years, you should remember my name. Of course, I knew her name, but in my mind I was thinking about the girl I loved. And it was Lily's name that I yelled that day. It was awkward.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Lily lived in the dorm with her friend, Zoe, who actually did several exercises in Fortran. And so I complain to Lily that I can't figure out why my spline approximation in Fortran doesn’t work, and she suggests asking Zoe.</p>\n<p>So I approach her, saying: can you help me with Fortran? And she: no problem. We set a time. I arrive at the dorm, Lily leaves and says that she will leave us alone. Of course, I was upset that she would not be there. But I came for Fortran! So, we opened the laptops, looked at the code, I started to understand why my iteration didn't work. But at some point, Zoe became irritated and unhappy. I was perplexed. So we finished with the code and I left.</p>\n<p>Later, when I played it all over in my head, I realized that she probably didn't know how naive I was when I asked this. Lily apparently set me up on purpose, made fun of her friend.</p>","excerpt":"Fortran is a very ancient language. In principle, simple and convenient for mathematicians.
