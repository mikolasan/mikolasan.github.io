I invested my time and life, but did I get anything back from them?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/projects/pet-project-navigator\">Pet Project Navigator</a>. Well planned classes and DB structure. DB implementation is crappy. The user interface is unusable. The code is outdated. It is possible to shrink it to yet another todo list, but it is easier to make it from scratch. This project took about six months of my nights.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/gamedev/sudoku-16x16\">Sudoku 16x16 (Godot 3.1)</a>. Some parts of the code are hard to understand (related to history and draft notes), but, other than that, it is a good project. It is not suited for mobile phone sizes and has no functionality to get new puzzles or to generate them on the device. Not much time was spent. I'm happy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/projects/imperial-russia\">Imperial Russia</a>. You can call it converter with Wikipedia integration. It took about six months, but finally it's in the Play Store. The design is gorgeous. Functionality is minimal, but it supports many layouts (except micro ones). Many additional features can be integrated.</p>\n<p>I feel my development experience not compete without significant success of the app. I learned a little about Java, found not pleasant things about Android API, survived many design iterations, the code is a bit mess, but it's OK and readable though, however functionality is minimal. No downloads. In other words I’m not satisfied with the current situation around my application.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/gamedev/pygame-roguelike\">Roguelike (PyGame)</a>. It is playable! It requires a little effort to finish, and it uses my \"engine\" written from scratch. Nothing special about gameplay. Just one month for the jam spent. I didn't win.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/gamedev/overload-godot\">Overload (Godot 3.1)</a>. The code is tangled as hell. I am lost in that class hierarchy that I have created. </p>\n<p>The next question is how to make money or get another profit (like stars on GitHub or views on YouTube)?</p>\n<p>I can do a screencast about game development and programming. Take that Python game and just keep going, because game development can be a neverending process.</p>\n<p>I can review my old code from Pet Project Navigator and apply new techniques to create a tutorial/online course about development in Java/ Android/ best practices.</p>\n<p>Sudoku solver can be some sort of programming language.</p>\n<p>But to get more money, I need to become a trader, start a business or invent new technology.</p>","excerpt":"My projects.
