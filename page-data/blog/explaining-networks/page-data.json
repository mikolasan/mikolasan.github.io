It’s doing something, but why?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>log what it's doing - then look at everything it's doing and follow the math yourself. if I do this x=1 y=? and then I do a bunch of math to wind up with y=2, if you look at every step I took, you'll know why I did that</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s say for every forward pass in the network we would trace transformation for every input. As some might argue, this will be a waste of computational resources, but we only assume theoretical possibilities here. Let’s consider just one input, a word. Then we have traces for every letter. It could be a vector of intermediate values, but that will be very cryptic. We rather need to answer why. Why are these values and not different ones? Then we add more information, because we know what formula gave us all the numbers. Then, having a formula and values, can we answer why? As a consequence of the answer, can we change something in the formula to control the outcome?</p>\n<h2 id=\"abstract-thinking\" style=\"position:relative;\">Abstract thinking<a href=\"#abstract-thinking\" aria-label=\"abstract thinking permalink\" class=\"with-anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\">\n                <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3\n                3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3\n                  9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64\n                  1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\">\n                </path>\n                </svg></a></h2>\n<p>Statement: abstract thinking goes beyond the experience of direct encounters.</p>\n<p>Proof.
