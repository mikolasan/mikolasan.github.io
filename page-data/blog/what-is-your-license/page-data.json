Further, you may not combine EPL and GPL code in any scenario where source code under those licenses are both the same source code module.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based upon the position of the Free Software Foundation, you may not combine EPL and GPL code in any scenario where linking exists between code made available under those licenses. The above applies to both GPL version 2 and GPL version 3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or simplier <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLIncompatibleLicenses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In terms of GPL compatibility, the Eclipse Public License version 2.0 is essentially equivalent to version 1.0. The only change is that it explicitly offers the option of designating the GNU GPL version 2 or later as a “secondary license” for a certain piece of code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If an initial contributor releases a specific piece of code and designates GNU GPL version 2 or later as a secondary license, that provides explicit compatibility with those GPL versions for that code. (Doing so is roughly equivalent, for users, to releasing that piece of code under a dual license, EPL | GPL.) However, the EPL2 without this designation remains incompatible with the GPL.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Links to start digging into the problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://choosealicense.com/licenses/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://opensource.org/licenses</a></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"What are the essential differences between the BSD and MIT licences? 1 Are the Eclipse Public License (EPL) and the General Public License…","tableOfContents":"","fields":{"socialcard":"gatsby-plugin-social-card/d7310c4d-499c-53bb-9cb8-b41fc3cb1ded.jpg"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 02, 2020","published":"May 09, 2020","lastModified":"October 14, 2021","title":"What is your license?","subtitle":null,"section":null,"draft":null,"developing":null,"buttonText":null,"buttonLink":null,"secondButtonText":null,"secondButtonLink":null,"featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"showLikes":true,"absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mikolasan.github.io/mikolasan.github.io/src/markdown/blog/what-is-your-license.md","url":"/blog/what-is-your-license","next":{"excerpt":"Why do I hate Python?
