So, what is your IDE and how you are satisfied with it?</p>\n<p>I will tell you how many tools I have tried before.</p>\n<p>Back in the day I was using proprietary IDEs licensed by my university. I used <strong>C++ Builder</strong> (Embarcadero RAD Studio nowadays) and <strong>Visual Studio</strong>. Not complicated university projects on Windows. It was more than enough.</p>\n<p>Then Iâ€™ve got a job where special IDE was used. Okay, \"special\" is too much here, just vanilla qscintilla with search functionality. It was even nowhere close to <strong>ZeroBrane Studio</strong>. At some point (after 2 or 3 years ðŸ˜²) I realized that I will be more productive using better tools.</p>\n<p>No, just kidding. I was not that smart ðŸ˜‚ So happened that it was time to start a new project in C++. My previous experience with <strong>Qt Creator</strong> and <strong>Code::Blocks</strong> was not satisfying. I also tried <strong>Emacs</strong>, but was not able to run a debugger from it. So I have started searching.</p>\n<p>I had the following criteria. It should</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have a nice interface (dark theme)</li>\n<li>work on Linux</li>\n<li>be free</li>\n<li>support many languages (highlighting)</li>\n<li>have autocomplete and code snippets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Almost no choice. And I install <strong>Atom</strong> ðŸ˜±</p>\n<p>Why not <strong>VS Code</strong>? Because it looked like a text editor that Microsoft removed from Visual Studio just to have a mark against \"yes, we support Linux\".</p>\n<p>Only now I prefer VS Code over Atom. But if you never tried Atom you do not know what is a comfortable search across all project files (Ctrl+Shift+F).</p>","excerpt":"You will be more productive using better tools.
