As usual, I have started looking into Pinterest boards to find suitable design ideas. My search was around arcade machines, arcade button consoles, and custom enclosures for Raspberry Pi and such. Not many cases are made out of plywood. I found some boxes with interesting engravings, but I focused on a combination of shapes and materials, while the comfortable layout of buttons can be arranged on it.</p>\n<p>A box with buttons is a beautiful thing by itself, nevertheless, I expected to make a MIDI controller that can be connected to my computer for producing drum sounds in the DAW.</p>\n<p>But the idea is going crazy here. Instead of adding MIDI logic to buttons with Arduino or Raspberry board, the plan is to connect buttons with a USB cable to the mobile device as an OTG device, get inputs from button deck or user interface, and send it as MIDI signal out. I tried MIDI piano on my tablet and can recommend one application: MIDI Keyboard from Dreamhound Studios. So learning USB protocol was an appealing bonus in this project, although it can be done without the mobile application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"links\" style=\"position:relative;\">Links<a href=\"#links\" aria-label=\"links permalink\" class=\"with-anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\">\n                <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3\n                3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3\n                  9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64\n                  1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\">\n                </path>\n                </svg></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/simonnorberg/dmach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">DMach</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.planeth.vabeastdemo&#x26;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow noopener noreferrer\">G-Stomper VA-Beast Synth</a></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"After I finished a project with an acrylic case that was laser cut by a layout that I simply downloaded from the Internet, I decided to find…","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#links\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"socialcard":"gatsby-plugin-social-card/e282d7e3-7907-59f8-af7d-3d8bae690d55.jpg"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 16, 2020","published":"October 28, 2021","lastModified":"October 28, 2021","title":"My Drum Machine","subtitle":null,"section":null,"draft":null,"developing":null,"buttonText":null,"buttonLink":null,"secondButtonText":null,"secondButtonLink":null,"featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"showLikes":true,"absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mikolasan.github.io/mikolasan.github.io/src/markdown/make/drum-machine.md","url":"/make/drum-machine","next":{"excerpt":"With the increasing popularity of smart home devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), it's now possible to control lighting remotely from a…","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mikolasan.github.io/mikolasan.github.io/src/markdown/make/connect-ws8215-to-esp8266.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Connect WS8215 to ESP8266","date":"2021-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","topic":null,"article":null},"id":"f9e710ae-db50-54f2-9fe7-49b9972a45a8"},"previous":{"excerpt":"I followed instructions from Make magazine (Volume 67) and I made a word clock.
