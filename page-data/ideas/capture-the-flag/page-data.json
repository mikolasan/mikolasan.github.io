There will be a hidden mask. When you apply this mask, it selects specific letters from the original text and tells you about the next step. I need to write such text that will slightly hint to the solution. Then in more limited amount of text I need to point to the following step. Maybe one will need to input a password to open next step or it can be a hint where to search for that.</p>\n<p>First, I thought to use a picture for text. This will force to keep lines and vertical alignment. But if I use the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;pre></code> tag or an SVG image - that might work too.</p>\n<p>And to hide the mask in a browser reader mode? Possibly?</p>","excerpt":"Idea of the day. I want to design a challenge.
